What is the importance of client assessment in building trust and effectively addressing their concerns?,"["" the ability to utilize the skeleton of that to form out and flesh out the rest of the call is, is instrumental to having success. So when we, when typically when we walk in the door, you know, we're, we're interacting with the client and there's going to be some type of assessment, like what is going on? You know, obviously the client is not having a good day. There's something wrong, something in their life, like you already mentioned. And you said about calling it out and helping them feel relieved. What does that like, what does that look like practically? I mean, do you just say like, wow, it looks like you have water coming through your ceiling? Or are there any types of specific ways of phrasing that to help relieve the pressure while still not being read as calloused or like you don't care about my house? Yeah, that's a great question because it's drawn the distinction. Like you're not doing an observation of the facts. You're doing an observation of their reaction to the facts. So what's their reaction to having a war come to their ceiling? Like this is the last thing that you wanted to have happen today. This is – you, you, you gotta, you gotta look things in mind. I mean, this has got to be driving you crazy and you wish that I'd gotten here sooner. And you want to know that I know what I'm doing and you want to know that I could fix this and you want to know that you're going to get charged a fair price for it. I mean, so you're not calling out the facts. You're calling out their reaction to the facts. That's the first subtle distinction in the process of getting them in a mental mind frame where they trust you. And they trust that you're going to treat them fairly and they trust that you appreciate how the situation is for them. Now, Chris, in the book, you also mentioned something called labeling, where you're taking the feelings that they have and packaging them up and using a phrase like, I'm sure that makes you feel like this. Or does that make you feel like that? Yeah, it's like it's calling out their emotional state. But what does that then calling out their emotional state um but what what does that then do to their emotional state yeah and this is very much as their negative emotional state because this is where your real emotional intelligence advantage comes from and let me use the elephant in the room analogy again, because the negative emotional state, how they feel about the situation is the elephant in the room. And you never got rid of the elephant in the room by denying it or ignoring it. What you do is you call it out. So there's no science experiments that have shown this a number of times. If somebody is in a negative mind frame, if you can just hang a label on it, if you just call it out, if you just identify it, don't deny it, but simply identify it, then neuroscience has shown us that that's the most effective way to get it to dial down, to turn down, to diffuse, to dissipate. They did an experiment. They put people in something called an fMRI, which is like a big helmet thing that tracks the electrical activity in your brain. And then they showed them pictures that caused them to feel sad, unhappy, angry. The pictures just gave them negative emotions. And they simply asked the people, what are you feeling? And when the people just called it out or labeled, I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm lonely, I'm frustrated, I'm upset. The machine that tracked the electrical activity in their brain showed the electrical activity in the negative part of their brain reduced every single time. And so it was just hanging a label on it, just calling it out, just identifying the negative part of their brain reduced every single time. And so it was just hanging a label on it, just calling it out, just identifying the negative emotion. And a critical issue here, too, is not denying. And what would that look like for a plumber or an electrician? You know, say when you're talking about the bill, and you say, I don't want you to think this is going to be expensive. That would be denial. That would be the improper way to say it. The proper way to say it would be, you're probably going to think this is expensive. And that's an actual relief for the person that's hearing it. That two millimeter shift, that black swan shift from denying a certain negative emotion that you have sensed that they either are feeling or are going to feel and simply calling it out. And that's what the label is. It's not a denial. It's just calling it out. You also speak about a concept of mirroring. You also speak about a concept of mirroring. And in the home, as a service professional, you're often dealing with somebody who's trying to""]","The importance of client assessment in building trust and effectively addressing their concerns lies in understanding their emotional reaction to the situation. By calling out their emotional state and labeling it, you can help diffuse their negative emotions, making them feel understood and more likely to trust you.

Why is ridicule considered a powerful factor in publicity?,"["" want to have happen, they're the things they don't want to have happen. All I've got to do is sort of flip it the other way around and make them worried about the things that they don't want to have happen. And then that changes their behavior because fear of loss is the number one driving. Myself, a lot of psychologists believe that fear of loss is the number one thing that drives our decisions. Psychologists usually fall into one or two camps. You make every decision based on either fear or love. Others say you make every decision based on fear of loss. Whichever of those two areas that you fall into, the bottom line is fear and fear of loss are a big determinant in how people think. So I just recognize that and then just use the tools that I'm given. What do you say to people who say that there's no such thing as bad publicity if you don't have any to begin with? Most people don't like to be laughed at. And that seems to be the one thing that hurts. Ridicule seems to be the one thing that hurts. Ridicule seems to be the one thing that even people that take that philosophy, ridicule seems to be the one thing that they don't like. So I understand the intellectual thought process behind it. The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about. But I haven't seen anybody yet that likes ridicule, anybody. So ridicule tends to be the one powerful sort of X factor black swan in publicity that makes a difference. The question is, when is time for threat and retaliation if you're put in that position? And when should you do it? Should you do it? Should you wait? You know, I tend to think of both of those things as like a nuclear strike. And it's just long, toxic residue. And you have the capacity for a nuclear strike, and people like the idea. But I don't know any time that people after the fact have said, yeah, that was the right thing to do. I've had negotiations go bad. And one went bad earlier this year. And I still regret the loss of that relationship and I will try to repair it. year and I still regret the loss of that relationship and I will try to repair it. One of our main core philosophies is no deal is better than a bad deal and one of that was a bad deal that stretched out over three years and we made a lot of money, it was blood money. It was painful, painful. And I ended up very angry and upset at a lot of the people that I blamed for that. And still want to do what I can do to repair those relationships. So it's hard, and emotionally, intellectually, I just don't want things going bad, and if they did go bad, I'm gonna try to fix it at some point in time, because we're all still in the same environment. I mean, the residue from negativity and people paying you back is brutal. It's just really, and on top of that, I don't want a reputation, because then that reputation gets around. If you're quick to pull the trigger, even if somebody deserved it, people find out about it. And then they're reluctant to deal with you. So many more people judge your actions that are not directly involved in the action. I like to say the most important person watching me is not the person in the interaction, but somebody is watching how I conduct myself. And they're gonna try to, and the most powerful people sit back and study you for a long time before they trust you to put you in really phenomenal deals. So I'm not a big believer in retaliation. I'm just not. Yeah, well, there's an old saying. It was attributed to Goldman Sachs, you know, greedy, yes, but long-term greedy. You know, short-term, you can go after them. Long-term, your most valuable commodity is time. Everybody in here has one commodity that's exactly equal to Warren Buffett's, exactly equal, every single day. He's got 24 hours, and we've got 24 hours. So your most valuable commodity is time the Step back and and what's your rate of return of investment of chasing a bad debt versus cutting your losses and moving on? It's Ike psychologically you've been cheated that person has hurt you and you want to pay him back and Revenge is a dish best served cold, as they say. But if you're going to be long-term greedy, the best return on the investment of that scarce commodity of time that you have, that 24 hours a day, nothing more, chasing a bad debt or moving on and going on to a better opportunity. I've seen a lot of companies that have really begun to turn the corner in their profitability when they understood how to cut their losses and move on. Very easy to say, very hard to do. I'm still working on that now.

What is the difference between listening and hearing in the context of negotiation?,"["", among negotiation. What you just said is a theme of nearly every thinker out there. And I've heard it so many different ways. An early business negotiation book that let me know that hostage negotiation applied to business. Jim Camp wrote a book called Start With No Back in 2002. And Jim used to call it the re-re-reaction. Yeah. Trying to get you out of the instantaneous reaction. And I think if you go all the way back to the Stoics, I just picked up Marcus Aurelius' book, Meditations. It's all about that. How are you responding versus how are you reacting? Yeah, absolutely. Thinking from 2000 years ago, right? Yeah. Yeah. I love it. I love it. So again, our audience is the achiever. I want to really encourage everybody to take a listen to what we're talking about here today. It's about balancing and protecting relationships and being assertive, but it's also about making sure that you are knowing what your boundaries are. And I think that's a critical thing. You know, just one, a few more questions. I'd love for you to give just our basic listener a couple tips on negotiation. If there were some basic things that you would say, hey, when you're talking with somebody, even if it's going out to dinner, what's a basic tip of negotiation you would encourage? Let the other side go first and make sure by checking in with them that you understand what their point of view is. No matter what that point of view is, it could be something you completely agree with. It could be something you completely disagree with. The act of making somebody feel heard is insanely transformative. And in point of fact, they'll probably give you some really good information in the process. Like one way to be successful in a negotiation is to be smarter at the end of it than you were at the beginning and gather some information. The other side's always going to have stuff that can enlighten you. They're always, always, always going to have stuff that gives you insight or gives you valuable information. And you don't gather information when you're talking. And you actually, while you're thinking about what you want to say, you're also not soaking in information. You know, just being silent is not the same as listening. Right. So, you know, make sure that you actually hear what's said and you think about it. It'll inform you. It'll make you smarter. You'll be better off than you were. And you're always going to get a chance to have to say what you want to say. You know, if you're talking about Colorado Buffaloes and Deion Sanders, you know, hearing what the other person has to say, no matter how much you're burning on what you have to say, it doesn't matter what the topic is. They're going to have a perspective. They're going to have information that's going to enlighten you. And they will be delighted that you listened. And they will enjoy the experience that much more. Interested people are interesting. You want to be the most interesting person in the room? Be the most interested person around. And so if you make it a practice to hear people out, you'll always make better deals. Always, always, always. I love that. Be the most interested person. Yeah. That's, that's great. And make sure you are listening, not just hearing, you got to be listening. Yeah, yeah. And listening, I guess it's, you know, contemplating, reflecting, analyzing, thinking about what the other side said. And, you know, again, I mean, I'm, Deion Sanders comes to mind, because I think maybe one of the hidden things why so many people globally admire him, and that are astounded by is he's coaching his own kids successfully. Like there ain't a dad out there that wishes they could coach their kids as successfully as Deion Sainz. Like how the hell is this guy doing this? Like his son is not calling him an idiot publicly. And I'm thinking, or his son's, you know, plural, obviously. And I'm just gobsmacked by this the other day, thinking like not only is Dan's kid, you know, a quarterback and a safety. Not only are these guys ridiculously good at it, but they're happily playing for their dad. I'm like, you know, I didn't want to go to work for my father. And and my son is as independent as I am. My son, Brandon, helped me build the company. And he, tired of his old man telling him what to do. And he's now independent of me. And I'm thinking it's a father-son thing. And the other day, I want to bring this up with, again, Derek Gaunt. And I just kind of throw this out there.

What are some effective communication techniques for saying no without damaging morale?,"[': That’s good, Farley. Now you’re learning. I’d like a sub-machine gun to blow everyone away.\nFarley: I’ll look into that.\nRoman: You’re doing good. You ever cheat on your wife?\nFarley: No.\nRoman: Watch yourself. I’ll kill someone. You ever cheat on your wife? Answer!\nFarley: I’ll see what I can do. I’ll have to think about that. I’ll look into that.\nPoor Farley. The only thing that makes this back-and-forth bearable is, of course, it’s fictitious. Just like in Farley’s case, in the real world we refrain from telling a hostage-taker no outright because we’ve devised ways to say it without saying it. Expressing it in a manner that invited collaboration and did not reject the hostage-taker personally. \nHere’s how you can say no as gently and as elegantly as possible without killing morale.\nPhase 1: “It sounds like you are in a tough spot. I’m sorry. I’m afraid I just can’t do that.”\nNotice Tactical Empathy on the front end. “It sounds like you are in a tough spot. I’m sorry. I’m afraid…” and assertiveness bringing up the rear with, “I just can’t do that.” \nLabeling your employee’s circumstances on the front end of an assertive no statement continues the Tactical Empathy because their innate desire to have another understand is alive and well. \nHere, “I’m sorry,” is important. Ego and authority may tell you apologies are signs of weakness. They imply that you made a mistake. Ego and authority hate that. The reality is that apologies are neutral. The issue is when, how, and why they are used. \nWhen linked to assertion or confrontation, they are effective at softening the blow.\nThe “I” portion of this statement is designed to bring the focus back to you. It does a great job of removing their justifications as reasons you should say yes. Keeping the focus on your situation tends to limit arguments from the employee and invites them to see things from your point of view. \nPhase 2: “I’m sorry. That just doesn’t work for me.”\nThis is another manner of saying no. It is a little more direct, retains the apology as a means of taking the edge off of the message, and keeps the focus on the situation.\nPhase 3: “How am I supposed to do that?”\nThis conveys no without cornering yourself or them. Tone of voice is critical because this phrase can be delivered as both an accusation or as a request for assistance. \nThe emphasis can be placed on the “how,” “I,” or “that” for very different effects. Depending on the circumstances, you may find it necessary to ask this question several times, with emphasis being placed on different words each time.\nThis also tends to have the effect of making the other side take a good look at your situation. We call this “forced empathy.” They will be less resistant to the no because of it. Forced empathy is the reciprocal empathy they show because you have consistently demonstrated Tactical Empathy. You are reaping the benefits of investing in it first. \nPhase 4: “I’m sorry. No.”\nThis is a slightly more succinct version of the above. If delivered gently, this is completely acceptable. \nPhase 5: “No.”\nThe last, most direct way of saying it is just to say it. It is not meant to be, “No!” Verbally, it should be delivered with a downward inflection and regard. \nParaphrasing Plus Labeling \nIf you can summarize your employees’ circumstances so well that they respond with “That’s right,” “Absolutely,” or “Hell yeah!” you are in a good spot. A good summary will receive a definitive confirmation. Hearing, “You’re right,” is not as effective. If you can grasp this distinction, you are that much smarter during difficult conversations. \nA summary is a combination of Labeling and Paraphrasing. It is summarizing what you have heard so far or know to be the case (Paraphrasing) and how the other person feels about the situation (Labeling). \nThis indicates two important things. You are listening to them accurately, and maybe even more importantly, they realize you are']","Some effective communication techniques for saying no without damaging morale include: 1. Using Tactical Empathy by acknowledging the other person's situation and expressing regret before stating your inability to comply (e.g., 'It sounds like you are in a tough spot. I’m sorry. I’m afraid I just can’t do that.'). 2. Keeping the focus on your situation to limit arguments (e.g., 'I’m sorry. That just doesn’t work for me.'). 3. Asking 'How am I supposed to do that?' to convey no without cornering yourself or the other person. 4. Delivering a succinct 'I’m sorry. No.' gently. 5.

What strategies do full fee real estate agents use to maintain their position and avoid cutting their fees?,"[""? Like if you bring two people together and you help navigate a deal, a finder's fee is typically 10%. So real estate agents at full fee are still a great bargain. There's no reason they should ever be cutting their fee. And all right, so is there a reason not to do it? Yeah, of course. But then how do you not do it? I mean, that's what we really get into. We really get into how, how people in an opening conversation with a potential client says, I'm a full fee, full service agent. And then it stands, it sticks, agent. And then it stands, it sticks. You know, every conversation with a potential client is an audition. They're testing. Of course, they're going to ask you to cut your feet. They've been conditioned to do that. But if you can't stand up for yourself, you can't stand up for them. So the coaching practice is really getting people to believe in themselves, give them very specific tools of how to maintain their position, how to be great ambassadors for the clients and for themselves, and how to make a great living and to take the stress out of it. Like Steve, you were telling me once, I think one of his coaching clients was like, I'm going to watch Netflix this weekend. Is that okay? Is that what they said, Steve? That's exactly it. Because all of a sudden, they're getting their time back. One of the things that Chris says all the time, it's not a sin to lose business. It's a sin to take a long time losing business. It's a sin to take a long time losing business. And with the methodology that we teach in 15 minutes or less, and this is not a magic formula or a magic pill or instant anything. It's just that you have the ability in a very short period of time to get to the truth about whether someone wants to work with you or not. And you have an entire industry. Real estate is an industry that's built on a false premise. And that premise is that agents win or lose business based on their listing presentation. We're talking about getting listings for a second. The whole idea that you're going to walk into someone's living room and you're going to get their business based on your presentation and your ability to present. The whole industry is built on this premise and it's simply false. When you get that phone call that agents love to get, we're thinking about selling our home, and we'd like you to come out and talk to us and give us a presentation. You know, agents love that call. They get excited. Now they're going to put in two to four hours of prep work or more. Then they're going to go out to someone's living room and they're going to spend another two hours in the living room and they're going to give them everything they know for free. They're going to tell them everything they should do, the price, the home preparation, the marketing, everything. And then at the end of that presentation and anyone who is in real estate knows this, the client's going to say, wow, you've given us so much to think about. Give us a couple days and we'll get back to you. And that agent leaves that meeting not knowing, do they have the business? Do they not have the business? They're on pins and needles for 24 hours, 48 hours a week, whatever. And then they get that phone call. And the truth is, the truth is, prior to making the initial call, that seller either already knew who they were going to work with or they were leaning strongly in a direction. It has nothing to do with the presentation. Now, we're not talking 100% of the time. We're talking 80% or more. And one of the things that we're coaching agents to do is to only focus on those opportunities where they have an 80% chance or higher of getting the business. And we call that being the favorite. And the other 20% or less, that's when you're the fool in the game. And if you don't know you're the favorite, then by default, you're probably the fool in the game. So what we're teaching people is how to find out, am I the favorite or am I the fool? And you can do that on a Zoom call. You don't need to go out to the house. You don't need to make a presentation. And I've got one client in Northern California, in San Francisco, in a highly competitive market. In the last four years, she's taken over 100 listings, and these are just normal residential real estate listings, well over 100 listings, all on a Zoom call, all at 6%, keeping 3.5%. And you're listening to this, and you're going to say, that's impossible. However, it's not impossible. It's entirely possible.

What does it mean to listen as a team during a negotiation or hostage situation?,"["" no. Right. I know from my experience that when you say no, you feel in control. That's why people say no. Yeah. So you might want to give them a no so that they regain control or feel like it's five times as good as yes would ever be. So no is even better than yes. At least five times better. Really? Across the board in all circumstances. All circumstances. So you're trying to get them to say no or get to a no, I should say. Well, business deal. I lay a proposal out in front of you. Instead of saying, would this work for you? I'll say, is it ridiculous to think this might work for you? Yeah, of course I would say no. Unless it's actually ridiculous somewhere else. Well, if there are problems with it, when you say no, you say, no, it's not ridiculous, but here are the problems. If I say, would this work for you? You can't say yes, but here are the problems. It's really hard to do that. So you're scared to say yes because you think you just agreed to the deal. Right. So that's when you're going to go, maybe. And then you got to answer. You got nothing. You're scared to answer at all. But since since you've already when you've already said no to something, whatever you say after that, you don't feel there's obligations that go along with it. I said, no, it doesn't work. Here are the problems. I never said I'd agree if I lay the problems out. If I lay the problems out and you fix them, I will agree. But since I never felt like I said that in point of fact, if I fix all those problems, I now have a tailor-made solution to you that you felt in control. Right. So the no is almost like a highlighter. It's like you're seeing the invisible ink at that point. Yeah, that's an interesting point. Because you can, I'm telling you exactly what's wrong at that point. And then you can go, all right, circle, mentally circling these three things, change those. And then we, in theory, we have a deal. Yeah. Yeah. Instead of just having you shoot something down or lose control by saying yes, which you're not going to do, especially if the stakes are really high. Right, right, right. Got it. Okay. We've got a lot of people that are focused on that. They lay a proposition out to somebody and they'll say, you know, what's wrong with this? You know, what are the obstacles here? There's got to be obstacles. You know, help us identify them. So this is cooperative almost no matter what because you're doing a deal, whether the person's kidnapped a family member or they're robbing a bank or you're sitting across from them sharing a pot of tea at a business negotiation that's friendly or you're parenting your kid. So these are all cooperative regardless of whether or not it's all a business deal seemingly. Yeah. I would imagine that cognitive bias comes into play, especially when emotions are really high. And you talk about this a little bit in the book. Is that why you have people? All right, let me back this up. You see these things in movies, right, where there's a hostage negotiation and there's like the police captains on the phone and the commissioners on the phone and the mayors on the phone and the hostage negotiators on the phone and then some psychologists on the phone and there's 15 other people listening on headphones. One, is that accurate to what is the point of that? Are you trying to, is it sort of getting everybody's opinion? I mean, what's the point of all this? All those people are on the phone with a bad guy. Yeah. I feel like I see that a lot. You're only going to want to have one person on the phone. You're not going to want to swap out a lot of people. Oh, I Oh, well, let's think through a call. If people know how to listen as a team. What does that mean? Everybody got specific assignments, stuff you're listening for. Your only job may be to keep track of how long the conversation lasted. Why is that? Why is that important? Because the longer the conversation, it's an indicator we're making progress. Because it's sort of a trust barometer? Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment. So then I might have somebody else, you're only listening for the negative things that they say that, that sound negative or be construed as negative. You're only listening for the positive things they say. I mean, when somebody starts talking between the words that they say, and even more importantly, the words they don't say or their tone of voice, there's more information there than one person can keep up on""]","Listening as a team during a negotiation or hostage situation means that each team member has specific assignments and focuses on different aspects of the conversation.

What is the Black Swan Group and who founded it?,"["" different things that happened to me that kind of shaped who I was and why I wanted to go into police department, police work and how I dealt with my kids, you know, when they were growing up. So the one thing that is probably the biggest takeaway from that is situational awareness. Always know what's going on around you. Always know where you are, because if something goes wrong, you have to call 911. You can't give them a location. That's a problem. They can't come help you if they don't know where you are. And if you don't know where you are, you can't tell them because we're not to the sophistication yet where we can take every single cell phone and automatically find their geolocation. I mean, I have a feeling that'll be somewhere in the future, but it's not there yet. So you need to know where you are and it's, it's important. And so teaching my kids to kind of have that awareness of what's going on around them, to pay attention to things that are happening around them and, you know, be ready to react to different things and just knowing how to be safe. You know, you have doors, you have locks on your doors, use them. They're there for a reason. Don't just leave your door unlocked, you know, lock the door. There's a reason the lock is there. So just, it was almost common sense things, but I got a lot of feedback from a lot of different people, especially around, um, around dealing with their kids when it came to, you know, something happens that you don't like, you can speak up, you're allowed, give them permission to say, you know, I don't want you to do that to me and give them kind of domain over their own body to be able to say, stop that. And, you know, that has, that's changed a lot of people too, because a lot of parents don't realize that kids need permission to kind of buck the system if something bad happens and if you give them that they'll be safer for it you know they'll feel they'll they'll be safer for it so that was kind of my big thing yeah and I mean I have three young people myself I know we were talking about that we both have three daughters, right, Sandy, but it's very, it's very noticeable to me that this awareness of risk becomes a little bit later in life. And I think the thing about young people, it's, it's, they need to be told, really, they need to understand where the risks are, where the dangers are. And if nobody's talking to them about that, whether they listen or not, they're not going to have that awareness naturally, are they? No. And it's very easy because it's kind of like they always say, if you're going to teach your kid a foreign language, teach it, you know, in the first four years, because their, their minds are able to take in all of this stuff. So it's the same with this. I mean, my daughter, my youngest, especially when we would drive around through the city she would say that's meemaw's house that's my school that's what you mean she and we would say where are we now and she would say we said where's this will you go that way so we made sure she knew it's just three so you can you can really kind of program kids to be aware of what's going on around them and to watch out for themselves at a very young age and it will work if you maintain but you can also teach them the communication skills from the black swan group in the same way and um you know that's something we're looking into also is is helping kids learn these communication techniques because i think they would do a lot to get rid of the bullies because they you know that they wouldn't be as prevalent if kids knew how to deal with them in a productive way. Absolutely. Absolutely. And, you know, bullying is an absolute scourge everywhere and it always has been amongst kids. And so, you know, it's just fantastic that you are thinking about about that situation and how to make a difference and how to improve communications. difference and how to improve communications and like you know I just think there's nothing more important than helping children communicate better and it's a shame that certainly over here I don't think those skills are really taught in schools at all not to you know any kind of advanced levels so yeah I think that's fantastic so just like to talk a little bit more about about Black Swan, Sandy, because some of my viewers and listeners might not know very much about this organization.

What was Chris Voss's role in handling international kidnapping cases during his time with the FBI?,"["": 108\ncontent: Kidnappings and missing people, the timing element is crucial, right? How long they're away, the less chance they have of coming back or something. Well, it depends upon where you are. It depends upon the industry. Kidnapping is a business outside of the United States. It's a very risky thing inside the U.S. But outside the United States, they're not someplace where they think they're going to get caught. They don't think they're going to go to jail. So it's a business. and go to jail. Right. So it's a business. It's a completely different approach. Interesting. Wherever you guys are watching this show, I would truly appreciate it if you follow or subscribe. It helps a lot with the algorithm. It helps us get bigger and better guests and it helps us grow the team. Truly means a lot. Thank you guys for supporting and here's the episode. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the show. I'm your host, Sean Kelly. We got a legend in the building today, Chris Voss. How's it going, my man? Great. Yeah, happy to be here. Very happy to be here. So what you been working on lately? I see you speaking everywhere, going on a bunch of shows. Yeah, well, you know, getting out there. We're going to do a real estate conference in the spring and looking to do more stuff overseas. Just got back from Dubai. Wow. Heard there's a lot of money out there. Dubai is a crazy place. It's a safe haven for money these days. Yeah. So you're shifting into real estate, you said? Well, I've been coaching real estate agents with this guy named Steve Schultz for six years. And we put out a book. Now it's been out a year, The Full Fee Agent for Real Estate Agents. And we decided we're going to do a conference for real estate agents in the spring. So, you know, kind of been dabbling in it for a while. Steve's an interesting cat. He was, I think I knew when I first met him six years ago that he played in the NFL. Okay. But I knew him for four or five years before I found out he was a Super Bowl captain. Wow. Now, normally people that attain that level, you know, you know it in the first five minutes. They make it known. Yeah, but Steve is, he's more focused on today than what he did in the past. That's cool. So he's a good guy. I like him a lot. And I feel like you're similar, right, with your FBI past, but now you're in a whole different space with business. Completely different space. Yeah. And it's a lot, it's a different challenge. It's a lot of fun right now applying the ideas to every aspect of personal life. Other than, you know, the FBI time was great. I loved it while I was there. I wouldn't give up a moment of it. And it's behind me. Right. How stressful were those days? Were you waking up really stressed out? I would say no. I'm not sure what the people around me would tell you. But I always thought it was a privilege. And you don't feel stress when you're when you're doing something you feel is a privilege so and then I you know I did it especially the international kidnapping stuff I was dedicated to international kidnapping pretty much for about seven years wow and so that's uh that isn't any days off yeah but I think I was a little burned out when I left but you don't find that out till you get out the door yeah Yeah. So what's that process like? It gets put on your desk, a kidnapping case, and you have to, from there, make some phone calls and figure out what's going on? Well, you find out about it, and I had a really good relationship with the Department of State. Department of State usually are the first ones to find out about it because they've got a robust presence overseas in embassies. And robust presence overseas in embassies. And if somebody in your family gets snatched, pretty good chance you're going to let the embassy know quicker. What does that mean? I would usually find out before FBI headquarters did. Wow. Which to no end of frustration to the guys at SIAC, Strategic Information Operations and Command at FBI headquarters, they thought it was their job to call me to let me know, and I would call them to let them know wow uh which would annoy them yeah but you find out and then then you're anywhere from six to 24 hours into the game you know behind that behind the clock when you first start somebody's been grabbed bad guys have probably had him for at least had him had him for at least 24 hours, which means they're already reaching out to family members.

What is the benefit of using calibrated questions in communication or negotiation?,"["" trying, eventually they'll respond to that because they'll realize you're not asking them questions. I mean, you have to be, first of all, you have to be willing to put the work in because this stuff doesn't come naturally to a lot of people. And even in our group, there are skills that some people use that they like better than others. I happen to be a huge fan of mirrors. That's my favorite skill because mirrors are simple. I don't have to think much for a mirror. Whatever you say, I just mirror it. I either mirror it down saying I understand or I mirror it up asking for more information. So mirrors are really, really simple. Now you can't keep mirroring because you're going to start to sound like a parrot, but you know, mirror two or three times with genuine interest, you know, genuine curiosity about what's happening on the other side. And the response that you get is going to give you more information. And by the time you get a good amount of information, you can make a nice deep label about what's happening with them. And then they feel completely heard and understood, which are the two things people want more than anything in the world anyway. They feel heard and understood. Don't have to think much. Oh, nice. Good, because you didn't go over five words. Three to five words, top for a mirror. Good, because you didn't go over five words. Three to five words taught for a mirror. But yeah, you don't have to think much with a mirror because if people, well, really to use any of these skills, you don't have to think too much because people are giving you everything you need. You just have to relax and soak it in and let your intuition tell you what to point out. Yeah. Again, you're playing off the information you're given. So you got labeling, right? Labeling emotions, you have mirroring. So repetition of three to five keywords that the other person says. What are some other effective techniques that you can use when negotiating or frankly, communicating with people? Yeah. Dynamic silence. Because the problem I see with a lot of people when they first start using our skills is they just start slamming the skills out there, one after another. Here's a mirror, here's a label, another mirror, another label, and the other side's getting like put through the ringer because they're trying to keep up with you, right? When you use one of our skills, you should always pause for a few seconds afterwards before you do anything else because you have to let their brain kind of catch on to what you've said and then process it before they can give you a response. So, and believe it or not, dynamic silence should be the easiest skill in our skillset. And it's actually the hardest for most people because you have it in your head. You just want to keep putting it out there. You want to keep going. And so you have to make this make this conscious effort to put this pause in the conversation. And it's really hard, but it's important. Use the nice, yeah, actually you've used a lot of skills since we got on here. You've been doing some labels and a couple of calibrated questions. Pretty good use of the skills there. So one of, one of the things that's easiest for people to learn usually right off the bat is to stop asking questions that you're pushing for a yes. If you're trying to get a yes answer out of someone, flip the words around just a little bit so that they can say no instead of yes, but it means yes for you. Because pushing people for a yes makes them feel trapped, makes them feel like they're making a commitment, makes them feel like they're not sure what to say because are you tricking them? Are you putting something on them? Or are you pushing them so hard? It just gives a bad feeling. So instead, allow them to say no, but it means yes for you because, I mean, let's face it, one of the first words people learn to say when they're babies is no, right? I you learn to say when their baby just know right i mean anybody's had anybody close to two years old all they know is no no no no doesn't matter what it is no it's no so everyone likes to say no they're protected they feel safe it saves their autonomy so i am one of the biggest this is one of the biggest examples we give people because it's the one that makes the most sense when you call up somebody and you say do you have a few minutes to talk and the person first of all freezes because they go ah and then they all this stuff goes through their mind in like 0.2 seconds do i have a few minutes to talk if i do i don't want to talk to you if i want to talk to you don't want to talk about what you want to talk about""]","The benefit of using calibrated questions in communication or negotiation is that they allow the other person to say no, which makes them feel protected, safe, and maintains their autonomy.

What are some signs that indicate a problem with the price during a negotiation?,"["" I threw out a price and you're staring there with a blank, quizzical look on your face. And it's been going on for at least eight seconds now. Why? What are they telling you? They're telling you, I got a problem with that price. There's no way I'm going to be able to make that price. How am I going to go back and explain to my bosses that this is as far as you're willing to go? All of those things are, so you're overloading them and they're stymied and they're looking for a way out. It seems like I'm failing to be sensitive to something that's really important to you. Sounds or it looks like something just crossed your mind. That's it. Looks like I'm sensing some hesitancy. Any one of those would be appropriate because that's what they're screaming at you. They're screaming at you that I don't like this. There is hesitancy here. And so for you to pick up and they never said this is that I've got a problem with the price. They never said that I'm hesitant in moving forward in the conversation based on the price. That's just what you picked up. That's what your intuition is telling you. And if your listeners don't take anything else away from this discussion, rely on your intuition is going to be screaming at you what's going on with the counterpart. And it's rarely wrong. It's going to be screaming at you. You're going to be, you're picking up on data that you have no idea you're picking up on. Your conscious brain processes 40 bits of information per second. Your subconscious brain processes 20 million bits of information per second. You're picking up data out of the atmosphere based on what the counterpart is giving you. So rely on it. It's never going to fail you. It's kept us alive for thousands of years. It's never going to fail you. And so for you to pick that up, here's the golden ticket. You are articulating for them something that they cannot articulate themselves. And when you're able to do that, you are, there's no clearer way to convince or to convey to the other side that you are dialed in. You're dialed in to them, how, what their perspective is, what the lay of the land looks like from their side of the table. When you start to identify things that they have not said, oh, it's huge. It's huge. And then you put yourself on their side of the table subconsciously because you're like, this guy understands me. Yes. The flip side of that is now I owe him. They're thinking now I owe him. He has, this is why we sequence the conversations the way we do. You mentioned it earlier. It's always tactical empathy first. Your goal and objective comes last. We do it first because we want to take advantage of the reciprocal nature of tactical empathy. It feels so good to receive it that your counterpart now subconsciously is obligated to give it back to you. Derek, I want to get into tactical empathy here shortly, but first I want to ask you a question. Why are we so terrible at communication? Why is that the default? Because you would think it would be the opposite. You'd think as humans that we all are like, okay, communication, we get this thing, but you'd think it'd be a natural thing. But for all of these people that are listening to this, and as I'm sure you've seen by communication skills are going to be, it's just night and day difference with people that are successful in any regard.'s just night and day difference with people that are successful in any regard. It's night and day difference with people that have communication skills and they understand to get what you're saying. And it clicks, they're able to go off to the races. So why do you think this is? And now we're leaning more towards a word vomit society where everyone just has to scream their opinions at everyone and there's less and less communication going on why do you think that is and what can we do to remedy this to solve the world problems that one in one quote no pressure man solve russia and ukraine on one quote when you boil it down to its very essence the style of communications that we espouse at the Black Swan Group takes energy and it takes effort. Most of us are too lazy to do it. There are five different levels to listening. Even those people who think that they're good listeners are underperforming. And that's because they failed to realize that there's five different levels to listening. There's intermittent listening where I'm listening to you, Ben, long enough to get the gist of what you're saying. And then I refocus on my own internal monologue.

How does mirroring demonstrate that you are listening in a conversation?,"[""brace it.\nTakeaways\nLearning the skills of Tactical Empathy is like learning a new language. \nThe Quick Two, Plus One showed you how to put those skills into practice. \nLabeling is tentatively identifying the dynamics, emotions, or circumstances implied by the other person’s words, actions, or demeanor. “It looks like,” “It seems like,” or “It sounds like.”\nMirroring allows you to follow wherever the other person leads the conversation and demonstrate that you are listening by repeating back the last one to five words or the gist of what they’re saying. \nSilence gives you the opportunity to present yourself as selfless. With it you show you are less concerned about yourself and more interested in learning about them. \nLook at a difficult conversation not as an opportunity to impose your will but as an opportunity to discover information.

How do hubris and risk-taking manifest in individuals who fall into the trappings of power?,"[' \nCasey was dumbfounded. \nRiordan was satisfied. He had imposed his will. One way or the other, she was going to acknowledge his station in life—ego and authority, along with their cousin, narcissism, at their worst.\nMichael Lehr, President of Omega Z Advisors, says that people who fall into the trappings of power experience several changes. \nThe first is dopamine surges, causing increases in hubris and risk-taking. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain’s reward and pleasure centers. It also assists in regulating movement and emotional responses. \nHubris develops when self-confidence and pride reach extreme levels. \n“When we behave in a narcissistic manner and see ourselves as superior with exaggerated self-belief and overwhelming contempt for others, we are following a hubristic path. Our overconfidence often leads to disaster, as we become incompetent due to arrogance and self-delusion.” \nRisk-taking, by definition, defies logic. Why do people do gamble? Why do they BASE jump or swim with sharks? It’s the dopamine. Those brief moments of ecstasy that keep most risk-takers coming back for more and more. Birth of an addiction.\nSecond, when people view themselves as more important than others, a sense of entitlement sets in. They assume they “deserve” a certain outcome—a promotion, a win, an accolade—because of who they are and their past efforts. \nThey think, I earned it. I’m owed. I am due. I know what I deserve. Over time, this slowly dissolves the motivation and morale of the people around them. Their ego and authority will not allow them to value other’s time, energy and effort as highly as their own. It also causes them to overstate their abilities, render judgment and create unreasonable expectations. \nThird, rudeness increases as empathy decreases. Cruel remarks, condescension, and cutting people off or out of conversations is some people’s modus operandi. Rather than subjecting themselves to it, the followers withdraw. \nDeliberation decreases as well because while they are not always right, this type of leader is never in doubt. \n“One of the most prevalent—and damaging—themes in our culture is the need to be right,” wrote Mel Schwartz, a psychotherapist and marriage counselor. “From the more personal and mundane battle over who said what in the midst of an argument to the larger issues of politics, religion, abortion, health care, gun control or climate change, being right is mandated. It quickens our pulse, causes us to shout and can sever relationships. It is the raison d’etre for most acts of hatred, violence and warfare.” \nLastly, support of “brown-nosers” or “yes men” is evident and sought. Narcissistic leaders want the rubber stamp of the people they lead. Followers often have real difficulty offering opinions because they lack the courage or the skill to approach this type of leader with a message that runs counter to what the boss is thinking, saying, or doing. \nSometimes they display excessive respect for the role of the leader, their station within the organization, or their responsibilities. Other times they view the leader as “nice,” and people are reluctant to offer professional criticism to “nice” people. \nThe narcissistic leaders are well aware that they are not open to differing ideas. Dissension or disagreement has been met with negative consequences–transfers to difficult assignments, career paths impeded, and limited access to senior leadership. \nReed says the tendency for these leaders is to “one hundred percent eliminate those who showed resistance. This is a hallmark of poor leadership.” They are incapable of receiving loyal dissent. \nBefore most major organizational failures, somebody raised a hand and said, “‘Boss, this is not the right thing to do. You do not want to do this.’\n“The response is to banish the dissenter to organizational Siberia. Permanent midnight shift watch commander or in the little office down between the elevator and the men’s room in the basement.\n“There’s always a way that the organization can identify who’s on the outs. They abjectly fire them or move them out of the organization.” \nThis creates a culture of avoidance and reluctance among those who should be providing honest feedback. It leaves the leader ill informed, isolated, and in trouble. \nTakeaways \nIf you lose your emotional control, you lose respect. If you do, own up to it and apologize.\nEmotions are always involved in decision-making. Keep that top of mind, and know your triggers.\nAvoiding decisions for']","Hubris and risk-taking manifest in individuals who fall into the trappings of power through dopamine surges, which cause increases in self-confidence, pride, and risk-taking behavior.

Why is empathic listening considered to be so energy-intensive and rare in conversations?,"["" to shut your mouth so I can jump into the conversation to tell you how brilliant I am. That's where most of us do our dancing throughout the day. That to tell you how brilliant I am. That's where most of us do our dancing throughout the day. That's an easy lift. It doesn't take a lot of effort to do that. And that's why most people spend their time during that. At the deepest level is the empathic listening. That's where you're listening for emotion and logic and life's narrative and symbolism and meaning. and to listen at that level wipes you out. It just takes too much energy. When I got off of that bridge after seven hours, I must've gone home and slept for 15. That's how wiped out I was because it takes so much energy and effort. Back to your original question, why don't most people do it? Because people are lazy. We're in a microwave society. We want instant gratification. We make up our mind where we want this conversation to go. And we're pushing that direction regardless of whatever resistance we're getting from the other side, because that's what our goal and objective ultimately is. And we get transfixed on the fact that if I'm just able to explain to Ben what I'm talking about, if he had all the data information, he could see that this is the appropriate next step. And then Ben on the other side of the table is going, nope, nope, nope, don't want it. And you take that stance because what have I not done? I haven't taken the time. I haven't used the energy or the effort to demonstrate to you that I understand your frame of reference. This is what the environment looks like to you. And it's always, or at least there's a 66% chance that how it looks to you is going to be different than how it looks to me. You can't go into these conversations treating people the way that you want to be treated. You have to go into the conversations treating them the way they want to be treated. Because there are three personality types that we deal with in the Black Swan method. Three different personality types, which means whatever type you are, there's a 66% chance that the person that you're engaging is one of the other two types. So if you go in thinking that I'm a guy who's all about data and information, and if I treat them the way I want to be treated, I'm going to go in with all of my data and information. And those two other two personality types have no use for that. And so it's just a matter of effort. It's just a matter of trying harder. It's just a matter of being curious. Nobody's curious in today's world. This Russia-Ukraine thing, they talk about, we're not going to negotiate this. We're not going to negotiate that. There's no curiosity. There's no curiosity there. As a result, people are set in their ways and they dig in and now ego becomes a part of the equation because they view any compromise as capitulation and they're worried about how they're going to be viewed on the outside. So it's a combination of all of those things. But the bottom line is people don't assume that they've got something to learn. They think they know it all. Yeah. And one of the quotes that stands out to me from doing these interviews and from talking to all these people and being in the groups that I'm in is life changes when you, and this is in a social context, so it's a slight pivot, but not quite. Life changes when you go from the perspective of trying to be the most interesting to the most interested. And then life changes because then you are just like, to your point, that's when the curiosity arises. You stop trying to be the most interesting person in the room. You start trying to be the most interested person in the room. And the flip side of that is the interested person becomes interested. By default, the interested person becomes interesting when you start to project interest in, because all of us have this innate desire to have somebody else understand what we're going through. I don't care what space you operate in. I don't care what space you operate in. I don't care what corner of the globe you come in. We all have this internal drive to have somebody else understand what we're going through. And when someone does that for us, we're giving those people dopamine hits. We're changing chemicals in their brain. And they don't know why they like talking to Ben. They just know that every time they talk to Ben, they feel better about everything. And it's simply because you're lending that empathic ear. And interested people become interesting because you're an outlier. You're a one-off. You are that unicorn because most people don't care to that level. You don't believe me, Ben.

How did the experience of working on a suicide hotline prepare you for a career in hostage negotiations?,"["" did you ever cross paths with the fbi i mean i know completely different area but i interviewed jack garcia on this podcast a while back does that name ring about did you know jack i'm, no. Do you know who that is? No. Oh, he was probably considered the greatest FBI undercover agent. He sort of broke open the Gambino crime family and drug cartels and you name it, would be playing multiple personas all at once. So it's sort of fascinating to me, these niche, very important, but niche fields. So given that this wasn't percolating when you were growing up, when did this idea of whether it was the FBI first or finding some way to leverage negotiations in a future career, when did this start to come into your sights? Well, I had been a member of the SWAT team. I was on the FBI SWAT team in Pittsburgh. And I wanted to be on a SWAT team when I was a police officer. I just took the job with the FBI before I got transferred. So I like crisis response. And crisis response is decision making. You know, you got to make a decision. And, you know, Kennedy said a long time ago, the risks and costs of comfortable inaction effectively costs us far more than bad decisions now, if you're willing to learn. So I like decision making. And so I was nursing a knee injury. I had my knee reconstructed twice. And so I wanted to stay in crisis response we had hostage negotiators but i figure i had a shelf life as a swat guy so i figured you know how hard could it be i figured you talk to people i can't how hard i talk to people every day how hard could that be and so i just i made the transition and then i found it far more rewarding uh for me personally than SWAT ever was. I loved it. Before you got into the formal hostage negotiations path, they said that you had to spend some time working a suicide hotline. That was somehow a prerequisite. Maybe they wanted to test you and see if you would do it, but you did it. What did you learn from that experience? I think it was two things. They were testing my initiative. You know, do I take initiative? Do I take instruction? Do I take instruction from the right people? Do I, and then do I take initiative as a result of being smart enough to listen to the right people? You know, this quick down and dirty test for whether or not they're the right person. Never, never take advice from somebody who hasn't been where you're going or somebody that you wouldn't trade places with. And that's a real critical issue. They may be really smart people and have never been where you're going. And their advice is going to be worthless, no matter how smart they are. Or you wouldn't trade places with them in any way, shape, or form. And so I went to the head of the hostage negotiation team, crisis negotiation team in New York and got rejected. But then I persisted. There's got to be something I could do because I take initiative. I'm very proactive. She said, oh, yeah, there is. Go volunteer on a suicide island. I'm very proactive. She said, oh, yeah, there is. Go volunteer on a suicide highlight. So what I really learned from that is how quickly actual empathy gets people to change their minds. To make a decision on what they're going to do next, what their next step steps are. My boss, Gary Nessner, in crisis negotiation unit, did this thing called the behavioral change stairway, which is one of the steps to getting somebody to change their behavior. The top step is behavioral change. It's a mirror of the same dynamic on the crisis hotline. Somebody's going to kill themselves. How do you get them to change their behavior? Or a crisis hotline is not just suicide, but it's everything. How do you get them to take a different step other than the direction they're currently going? Empathy, tactical empathy, emotional intelligence in astonishingly short periods of time. And that's what I really learned. I mean, like the actual application of empathy, not sympathy, not compassion, the actual application of showing someone that they feel heard, how quickly you can get them to change their mind about the course of action. That's what I really learned from that. Yeah. Could I just double click on that? Could you share the difference between compassion and empathy? Empathy is about the transmission of information. Compassion is the reaction to that transmission. So empathy is, look, you feel really backed into a corner here. You feel like you got nowhere to go. Empathy for the writers in The Current Strike was, you feel that the future looks dim for you as a writer. AI, everybody's resorting to AI every way they possibly can. They're knocking themselves out to replace you. They don't feel that you're getting backed into a corner and the future does not""]","The experience of working on a suicide hotline prepared the individual for a career in hostage negotiations by teaching them the importance of actual empathy and how quickly it can get people to change their minds.

How can a longer lease term potentially benefit both parties in the negotiation?,"[""'s going to end. OK. Parking for our employees to easily get into the building, location-- all of that is very important to us. How much of a problem does it present to have parking close to the building that was dedicated to our individuals? I've got no issues as long as your individuals pay for them. BRANDON: OK. it sounds like if we can put things on paper regarding the longer lease term, we can lower the year-over-year increase. And then as long as we're covering parking, it sounds like we can have as many spots as we want. You can have as many as you want as long as you're paying for them, because we get pretty good revenue out of the parking spaces. All right. So it sounds like if you can go back to your team with a certain number of parking spaces that we might want to have allotted for our company, then it might be a little bit easier for them to swallow the year-over-year increase being lowered. Oh, for sure. OK very good. So if we can get this all to you in a timely fashion, ideally within the next 24 hours, how hard is it going to make it on them deciding on when we sign the lease? I'll talk to my team this week. I don't know. If we can work on a longer-term lease-- for three to five years-- I can try to convince them to expedite the process. I'll make sure that I add into there the fact that we're actually going to be providing you with paid parking spaces as well. Try to expedite? Yeah. They're the ultimate decision-makers. I'm going to express to them the need for expediency in this regard, but at the end of the day, they could drag their feet for 30 days. So I'll do what I can to light a fire under them, but there are no guarantees. I really appreciate everything you've said, working with me through this process. It's very generous of you throwing ideas on the table. Thank you very much. I've been droning on about issues, and ideally we're getting to my final ones here. This is my problem. It's not yours. I know we have to sign a renewal within the next 60 days. We'd love to have a decision made this week so that we can properly forecast. Yeah. I've got to tell you, man, this week is going to be really tough for me to get back to my team and to have them make a decision. Is 10 days too short of a time frame? It ain't much better. I'm probably going to need closer to 30. That might work. The other unfortunate part about this-- obviously we need to have this predictability. We need to have everything in place. There are other spaces that we're looking at potentially getting into in the short-term, and those include free parking. That changes things a little bit. I didn't realize that you were looking elsewhere. It sounds like I caught you off guard with that. Yeah, I didn't anticipate. It's a hell of a time in the conversation for you to throw that in. BRANDON: Yeah, well again it's completely my fault. Like I said, I've got a lot that I wanted to work through here today. I have people I've got to answer to, and it sounds like it's going to be hard for you all to accommodate us in the short-term. It may, it may not. Look, I don't know. I'll talk to my team this week. If we can work out a longer lease term-- three to five years for you-- I'm sure I can convince them that adding the parking spaces offsets the cost that we would incur if we had to replace you. All right. I know I'm putting you between a rock and a hard place. Is it completely impossible to make this easier for both of us to move it forward? It's not impossible, no. What do you need first? What I'd like for you to do is bang out an email, and you talk about what we talked about. I'll use that as ammunition when I go back to the team. It'll help me support my argument. And then, like I said, we'll see what happens. OK. So put everything in an email laying out what we discussed, make sure that gets in your hands, and you're going to take that to your team. DEREK: Right. And then you'll get back to me? Yeah. I'll try to get back to you by the end of next week. So what's today? Today is Friday, so next Friday. BRANDON: In the next week. Yeah. OK. Sounds like somewhere within the next 14 days we'll really be set on the best way to move forward. Within 14 days, you have my guarantee you will know one way or the other. OK, that works for me.\nid:""]","A longer lease term can potentially benefit both parties in the negotiation by allowing the year-over-year increase to be lowered and by providing the landlord with the assurance of paid parking spaces, which offsets the cost that would be incurred if the tenant had to be replaced.",simple,"[{'int_id': '169', 'kind': 'lesson', 'row': 168, 'source': 'util/live_dataset.csv', 'title': 'Follow Along Lease Negotiation Scene Practice'}]",True,"['How could we make this happen or give ourselves the best chance of negotiating better terms in that scenario?'

How can reacting to an accusatory tone of voice trigger a defensive neurological reaction?,"[': 165\ncontent: I\'m sure you\'ve been in this situation before. I know I have. Derek is your manager, who is upset with you, and you don\'t understand why. You want to try and uncover more information about why he\'s upset. Okay, Sandy, let\'s get this meeting started. I can\'t believe that we\'re in this situation. This situation? Yes, we missed our target goal. You need to get yourself in gear and come up with a new plan. So let me ask you-- there was clearly a mirror. You inflected upwards. What caused that? Well, you\'re a manager. You\'re dealing with several different things, and several different situations, so I was hoping you would expand on what situation we\'re actually dealing with that was causing you so much trouble. So what would a downward inflection-- what would that have done, if anything? How would that have changed the dynamic between us? If I had said, ""this situation,"" it could have come across the wrong way to you. Even with a good tone, with a downward inflection in that specific instance--  Yeah. --it could have been almost like a challenge to you. So instead, I sought information.\n\nCHRIS VOSS: In this situation, a more common response-- which would be bad-- would be to start firing back right away. You know, reacting to his tone of voice-- the accusatory, angry tone of voice. Like, what did I do? I didn\'t do anything. What are you talking about? And that tone of voice has a tendency to automatically trigger a defensive neurological reaction. The mirror\'s a great skill just to buy yourself some time. Like, I don\'t know what the heck\'s going on here. And the mirror\'s really great at buying yourself time without the other side feeling like that you\'re stalling, because you\'re not. You\'re trying to gather information, and they\'re probably not in the mood to answer questions, but you need to start triggering information and getting your feedback under you emotionally, because if you feel attacked, you\'re going to be off balance emotionally. As a general rule, the best preparation for getting caught off guard is to maintain a mindset of curiosity, period, because if you just get used to being really curious-- under any circumstances-- you know, political figure that you hate. If you were to ask yourself, wow, I\'m curious as to how they came to that. You know, curiosity is-- is a mindset-- some people say ""hack."" Others-- people just say ""effective mechanism."" It\'s impossible to be curious and angry. It\'s impossible to be curious and sad. Curiosity is this great, positive mindset. In a positive mindset, you can process more information faster. You\'re more likely to see patterns. You\'re more likely to see what\'s going on. And curiosity\'s a lot of-- it\'s a lot of fun to be curious. So it\'s easy to encourage yourself to continue to do it, because it\'s a mind frame that creates an upward spiral for you. You know, at the end of the day, you want to establish habits in yourself that help take care of you regardless of the circumstances.\n\nNow we\'ll see a different tactic in the same scenario as before. This time I\'m going to try a label to diffuse the situation. All right, let\'s get started. I cannot believe that we\'re in this situation. I cannot believe that we\'re in this situation. It sounds like you\'re stressed about where we\'re at. Stressed? Stressed is an understatement. I need to move fast. I\'ve got to take a plan-- a new plan-- to the executive board next week, because we\'ve missed our target goals yet again. Again? Again. When you threw the label out, and the-- the initial appearance was that it didn\'t diffuse, but it actually-- actually ramped me up a little bit. How did that land with you? It made me a little nervous, because then I thought, okay, that first attempt at kind of bringing him down a little bit didn\'t work so well. So my plan in my head was let him vent a little bit more. Mirror a little bit. Get a little bit more of the angst out. And then hopefully you would eventually kind of calm down a little bit, and we could have a better conversation.\n\nCHRIS VOSS: You probably wrote down a label that was different than Sandy\'s, and that\'s fine. It\'s okay, and here\'s why. First of all, you fired up the neural circuit in your own head, and you got some practice. Secondly, you had the opportunity to compare your gut-level instinct reaction at the moment with what was hers, and comparing the two reactions is a learning experience as well. You\'re better right now than you were before you wrote it down, and now you\'ve got some information to compare it to.

How does tactical empathy influence the outcome of negotiations?,"["" that happens in business negotiations far more in hostage negotiations. We calm things down earlier because the neuroscience behind a calming, soothing voice puts people in better decision-making positions. Well, let's just go there then with tone. Okay. So how are you thinking about tone when you're in positions. Well, let's just go there then with tone. Okay. So how are you thinking about tone when you're in a negotiation? Well, by and large, really, I'm trying to be a little more playful. The more I'm on a playful side, we'll both think better and we'll both think together more. There's a Harvard psychologist has this great TED talk, Sean Acker. I think it's the happy secret to better work where he says, you're 31% smarter in a positive frame of mind. So by being playful, I'm smarter, significantly smarter. And emotions tend to be contagious. So I don't want to be second mover in emotional dance. If I want you to be playful, I'm going to be playful first. If I want you to be calm, I'm going to be calm first. It's going to work on both of us equally well. So I will soothe and smile and joke around. And the chances that we reach a great deal together, just based on my approach, my tone of voice, playfulness, self-effacing humor is another way to look at tactical empathy. We're going to make better deals just based on my tone of voice. It seems like we have this notion in negotiation that we need to be very tough and kind of like alpha and never show weakness. But it sounds like that's not always your approach or the approach that you were taught or employ. Well, and it's how you package it in your brain. Like there's great power in deference. Some people are afraid of being deferential. I'm going to seem. Like there's great power in deference. Some people are afraid of being deferential. I'm going to seem weak. There's tremendous power in deference. You know, there's a difference between what is weakness versus what is just likability. I don't know that anybody would accuse Oprah of being weak. accuse oprah being weak she may be the strongest negotiator on earth based on the distance that she covered and continues to cover and she's really nice you know you you know you don't there are any pictures of her yelling at anybody or there aren't any stories of her kicking a chair across the room and she's and and there's no stories her past is not littered with enemies like what you know one of my favorite negotiations of oprah's and there are many um uh her interview of lance armstrong who i've run into and i know lance and i like lance a lot and there's a lot about him that i admire like they negotiated that interview he was not caught off guard by any single question that she asked him. You're going to go on camera and you're going to come clean for the first time on everything. That was a negotiation. The commodity was his answers in that conversation. And you don't hear Lance Armstrong bad-mouthing Oprah. And when you hear him talking about his history, there are some people with good reason that he feels betrayed by, and there are other people that stood by him. And, but he, you know, if you don't hear him complain about Oprah and Oprah didn't steamroll him, didn't kick a chair across the room, you know, so what is weakness is really in the eye of the beholder. Really interesting that we so often can confuse deference and likability with weakness. Right. And that just makes me think, you know, what other common mistakes or common misconceptions do people have about negotiation? You know, it's a great question. A lot of them. And what springs to mind quick is, you know, the apology, I'm sorry. I'm sorry afterwards. You know, you slap somebody in the face, you fail somebody, you say, I'm sorry afterwards. We don't prescribe that. The term I'm sorry in and of itself is that is not bad like if i'm getting ready to be assertive i'm going to say i'm sorry you're not going to like what i have to say i'm sorry i'm afraid i can't do that you know that doesn't make the words i'm sorry weakness what it does is it makes it actually respectful because i'm warning you the bad news is coming so there's there's a tremendous misconception in a very old style bargaining you know knuckle dragging negotiation that apologies are witness they're not it in quite often is respect and deference and emotional intelligence you know that's just that's just for starters um you know there's this style of negotiation of black swan method, tactical empathy.

It doesn't mean that women are any better at it""]","Tactical empathy influences the outcome of negotiations by using a calming, soothing voice, being playful, and employing self-effacing humor.

How are negotiation skills applied in both hostage situations and suicide prevention scenarios?,"["" that's their choice. It's, you know, we, we give them all the options and they, they make the choice. So, but there are a few that, um, went really well for me. And, you know, one in particular that I think of often, I think it's because there was a young girl involved, but there was a father who kept his daughter after visitation was over. He didn't take her back to her mom. And so her mom called and said, he has her, he won't, you know, he won't bring her home. And so she went to the house and he wouldn't let her in. He wouldn't let the daughter come out. So she calls the police. So we get there and within about an hour, he sent his daughter out. So, you know, I basically said, you're, you're putting her in the middle of this. You know, she, she, she's a kid. She doesn't know what's going on. She doesn't understand. And this is not helping anything for you to keep her in this situation with all these police officers. And he said, you know what, you're right. And he let her walk out the front door, but then he slammed the door and locked it and wouldn't come out. So now we went from a hostage situation to a lone barricade situation with someone who was suicidal. So it changes their gears. So, you know, it's, it's, it's hard to explain. It's a different negotiation, but it's the same negotiation. You're using the same skills essentially, but now you're in suicide prevention mode, which is exhausting. I mean, getting hostages out is exhausting, but suicide prevention mode when you're dealing with somebody is completely exhausting because you have to be on, on, on, not missing anything that they say and basically cataloging everything. And so that one took, that one took about six hours and he ended up coming out. And the only reason he came out, he basically said, I'll only come out for you. And I said, well, my rules are that I can't be there when you come out. If you come out, I will, wherever they take you, I will come see you. I promise. And so that's the only reason he agreed to come out. And so, you know, I'm nowhere near him at this point. I'm, you know, three blocks away in what we call our negotiations operations command center. And so, you know, I wasn't there. So there's no way I could be there when he came out, but when they took him out, they put him in the police car. And when I came over, um, the officer cracked the window for me and we had this nice little, you know, two or three minute conversation where he thanked me, you know, for basically talking sense to him and, you know, and it ended well. And that's what you want because the misconception about hostage situations is that it's a one-off that we'll never see this person again. But in reality, we do see these people again. And oftentimes it's not in our same jurisdiction, it's somewhere else, but they do get dealt with again. And if they have a bad taste in their mouth from dealing with the first negotiator, they're not going to be able to be influenced by the second one because they didn't leave them with a positive feeling. And that's the goal is you influence them to do what you want, but you also leave them feeling positive at the end of the interaction because that helps if they get into the situation again, you know know another time so yeah that that that is amazing I can only imagine what that situation must must have been like um Sandy um I'd love to hear more about your work with the Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance, because that sounds amazing. How did that? It was amazing. It was an amazing time. It's when I had been doing adult sex crimes for a few years. And I was with an organization called VASA, which is which was Virginians Aligned Against Sexual Assault. And so I did trainings and things with them. And then they decided that they were going to basically pair up with our domestic violence advocacy group for the state. So we all got together and it took about a year worth of meetings for us to come up with a name and to come up with, you know, the mission statement and all that stuff that we came up with. And so it ended up being that Virginians sexual and domestic violence action alliance. It's a mouthful. So we came up with that. And then once that was formed, we went around the state doing training in a lot of different things. And one of the main things, well, two main things I was involved in through them, things. And one of the main things, well, two main things I""]","Negotiation skills are applied in both hostage situations and suicide prevention scenarios by using the same essential skills, but with different focuses. In hostage situations, the goal is to safely get the hostages out, which is exhausting. In suicide prevention scenarios, the focus shifts to preventing the individual from harming themselves, which requires being extremely attentive and cataloging everything the person says. Both scenarios require influencing the individual to make positive decisions and leaving them with a positive feeling at the end of the interaction.",simple,"[{'int_id': '117', 'kind': 'interview', 'row': 116, 'source': 'util/live_dataset.csv', 'title': 'The Smart Connector - Mastering The Art Of Negotiation With Sandy Hein'}]",True,"['Hostage negotiation or business negotiation.'

Would you recommend writing down a script ahead of time to ensure the use of tactical empathy in difficult conversations?,"["" powerful weapon. Wow. Yeah, that's huge. Now, someone who's not in your position, who's not an expert communicator and is trying to learn these tools, would you recommend that if they're going into a difficult conversation like that, they write down their script ahead of time just to make sure that they're bringing in tactical empathy? Yeah, I think it's a great way to get yourself started. And if you're writing it down to put a fine point on it, handwriting is always better than typing. I haven't seen any hard science before, but some of the things I've heard, I believe to be true. A friend of mine once said you retain 40% more if you handwrite versus if you type. My theory is if you're typing, you've got 10 fingers, ideally, if you can type with 10 fingers, that are multitasking. Each finger is engaged in a different task simultaneously, which is bad for the brain. But when you're handwriting, you've got all five digits on one hand focused on one thing. And I think that's one of the reasons why handwriting is more effective, because it forces your brain to concentrate. I've also found myself to, I memorize things better when I handwrite. And simultaneously, I have more creative ideas when I'm handwriting. I agree. I heard that as well. And I haven't seen the science either that your working memory improves when you're writing something down. So you're more likely to retain it. A principal told me that once. Yeah, yeah. And I thought it through and I'm like, all right, so I got all five digits working together. It's drawing more of my brain into the same place. To me, I mean, that's my reason why it works. Yeah. Something spurred a thought when you were talking about our attention being all over the place when we're typing, because we have 10 digits that are in different keys. Have you changed your approach in communication now compared to when you first started years ago? Because everyone's attention span has shortened. Yeah, you know, I think so. I mean, I've always tried to listen really well. My biggest struggle is tone of voice. As a natural born assertive, if I don't watch it, the assertive tone of voice is the tone that's almost, is pretty much always counterproductive. And then also, you know, I also have told people that I have a resting serial killer face. You know, if I'm listening intently, you know, I'm going to scare you because, you know, I'll be listening so intently you'll think, you know, I'm imagining chopping you up and having your liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti or something like that. So people have a hard time looking at you when you're listening intently. Oh, they're scared. And I've actually had people say that a number of years ago. And I've actually had people say that a number of years ago. I'm trying to decide. I joined National Speakers Association a long time ago before the book came out. And I attended a meeting in L.A. and the speaker, she's a phenomenal speaker. Just absolutely phenomenal. I learned so much from her. And it was a small group. There's probably only about 20 of us in a room, not a big room. And I came up to her afterwards. And when I got to know her, she's like, look, you scared me. I mean, the way you were the way you were looking at me when I was talking, I I I didn't know what you had in mind, whether you want to kill me or what you want to do. Like, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I got a serial killer face. That's funny. That's funny. My husband, he has a very serious look on him as well. So I'm always thinking that he's mad or agitated about something. He's like, well, yes, stop it. You're pissing me off. I'm listening. Come on, sweetheart. That's my look of love. Come on. Yes, exactly. Don't you see I'm smiling inside? No, I have no idea. Your face never changes. And then he looks ridiculous when he actually tries to change his face. Like it looks goofy. Yeah, like it's painful, right? Exactly. Exactly. So another question, if you don't mind. Accurate thinking, I know, is a strategy you teach in effective communication. And with ADHD, we very often have a hard time differentiating between story and fact because of our past negative experiences, trauma, rejection, shame. Do you have any strategies to help in understanding fact from story with accurate thinking? Every human being, and clearly people with ADHD have it, this issue intensified.

It’s one of the key negotiation tactics that \nChris learned in his time with the FBI, and continues to use with all \nhis negotiation coaching clients. Only instead of reporting suspicious \nactivity, you’re calling out negative emotions.\nWhenever you sense that your client is unhappy, say so. It doesn’t \nmatter whether you know the reason why. It doesn’t even matter if \nyour interpretation of their mood is correct. If you see something, say 87\nGET THE ELEPHANTS OUT EARLYsomething: “Y ou seem upset/frustrated/disappointed, ” or whatever \nemotion fits best.\nY ou probably think this sounds crazy. Why would you call attention \nto a negative emotion—isn’t that just inviting it out to play? And what \nif you’re just imagining it—wouldn’t that just create a problem where \nthere wasn’t one?\nHere’s the truth: it’s impossible to speak a problem into existence. If \nyou’re mistaken, they’ll correct you, no harm done. If you’re not, and \nthere really are negative emotions happening, naming them actually \nreduces them.\nThat’s science. Studies have shown that when people label their \nnegative emotions, their physiological experience of those emotions \ndiminishes.10 All those stress symptoms that pop up when you’re upset—\nelevated heart rate, shallow breathing, high blood pressure, sweating, \nnausea, muscle tension, etc.—actually get better when you put a label \non what you’re feeling. (Remember labels from Chapter 2? Y ep, here \nthey come again.)\nWhy does this work? It all comes back to T actical Empathy, a.k.a. \nmaking people feel understood.\nWhen someone tells you not to feel something (Don’t be upset!), \ndoes that make you feel understood? Of course not. It does the opposite  \n—it convinces you that they don’t understand your perspective at all. \nDenying negative emotions has a 100 percent failure rate.\n10  Alex Korb, The Upward Spiral: Using Neuroscience to Reverse the Course of Depression, One \nSmall Change at a Time (Oakland: New Harbinger Publications, 2015).88\nTHE FULL FEE AGENTWhat about when they ignore what you’re feeling?

Not pleasant.\nY ou’re probably starting to see why labeling negative emotions is \nthe way to go. By calling them out instead of waiting for the other \nperson to bring it up, you show that you’re paying attention to how \nthey feel. When they feel understood, their brains release oxytocin, \nwhich mitigates the stress response. Y our label doesn’t fan the flames of  \nnegativity—it douses them.\nThis works even if the label is completely wrong. If you say, “Y ou \nseem upset, ” when they’re not, they won’t hesitate to say, “No, I’m just \nthinking through my options, ” or whatever else is going on in their heads. \nAs we mentioned in Chapter 2, a mislabel often leads the other person \nto reveal even more information than a correct label does.

"What is the main concept behind the book ""Never Split the Difference""?","["" our business. And then a month ago, I got to interview Steve Scholl, which was the co-author with Chris on the book, The Full Fee Agent. And so many of you listeners reached out and were so excited about those concepts in here. So I'm excited to talk to Chris today. Chris, how's it going? Hey, it's going great. I'm happy to be on with you. Thanks. I got to follow up Steve's show. I mean, you know, it's like going after Robin Williams and trying to be funny, right, Steve? Yeah, trying to be funny after the fact. Him and I had some fun on that interview, and I was learning a ton. I was taking notes as I was interviewing. How long ago did you actually, like, leave your business, your day job, and start writing your book? Well, two separate events. Leaving my day job, you know, I was an FBI agent. And, you know, what's the definition of retirement? I technically took a pension from the federal government two days after I was eligible. Yeah. two days after I was eligible. That was back in 2007. And started teaching and coaching negotiation for business right away. And then the book, Never Split the Difference, came out in 2016. You know, we took our time, my son Brandon and I, I wrote that book together along with Tal Raz. Brandon is an uncredited co-author. That's what dads do to you, right? Yeah. But, you know, we wanted to make sure we had a good system in Dan for negotiating under any circumstances. And so we taught at business schools for a while and test drove it and had our students test drive it in real life. Everything from Wall Street negotiations to negotiations between a husband and wife over a Christmas tree. Because it's human interaction. Long-term productive human interaction. Not where both sides lose. I've always hated that phrase, a good negotiation is when both sides feel like they've lost it a little or both sides are upset. That is not the formula for long-term relationship or repeat business no matter what you're doing for a living. If everybody's unhappy when they deal with you, how could that possibly be good for you long-term? And we never taught that at all. And enough students in the business school students were racking up successes. We put the book out in 2016. Yeah. We're racking up successes. We put the book out in 2016. Yeah. So going from being an FBI agent, a negotiator, a hostage negotiator, did you know right away that, like, hey, I'm going to be able to change some business lives too? Because you learned that process. You came up with those concepts. Did you know right away, like, I'm going to change a lot of lives with this stuff. I'm going to start a new business. Nah, you know, you hope for it. You hope the concepts apply. You start doing it yourself. You know, you want to find out if something works. Try it yourself. Walk the talk yourself. Yeah. And then learn and refine. And the real big triggering moment for me really was when I went through Harvard Law School's negotiation course while I was still an FBI agent. I wasn't a student at Harvard. I negotiated my way into the course. And, you know, they loved the idea of a collaboration with the FBI. And they said, look, you can't go through the course as an observer. You've got to be a full-fledged student participant. All the rules that apply to the other students can apply to you. And I'm like, all right, yeah, I'm game for that. And after I'd been there, you know, they said, you're doing the same thing we are. And the validation from Harvard really was the external validation to let me know that it applied to business and personal life. So that didn't happen until 2004. Yeah, that's pretty brilliant. They said, hey, you can come, but you have to be a real student in the class. Like you got to be all in. You got to kind of help each other, see if the right stuff's getting taught. Yeah, it was great. It was very generous of them to let me in, and I learned a ton from it. You know, when I tell people about your first book, Never Split the Difference, I explain it and say, look, the author was an FBI negotiator, and he was doing hostage negotiations, and you could never say, hey, I'll take half the hostage. Yeah, exactly. Right? You could never, you know, as part of your book. And it really summarized it in, like, a nutshell of the author.

What challenges are faced when running an international kidnap response?,"["" insulting. And so I started in a funny kind of way. I started applying this when I'm running our international kidnap response. I go to an embassy that's kidnapping the Philippines, the thing you read about earlier. I am unwelcome because somebody from Washington, D.C. shows up. The locals in the embassy, the message they get is they're screwing up. You're either screwing up or you're inadequate. Somebody from D.C. is not welcome. And I'm walking into a hostile environment every time. And because they were new to it, they didn't know exactly the response. They'd usually be doing something wrong. And I'd walk in. I'd start pointing out what they were new to it, they didn't know exactly the response, they'd usually be doing something wrong. And I'd walk in, I'd start pointing out what they were doing wrong. And my partner, Chuck Regini, who's in the story, whenever we'd walk into a room, he would start to flinch because he knew that I was getting ready to lay into these guys. And somewhere along the line, I learned to say, before I started criticizing him, I'd say, this is going to sound harsh. And then I'd criticize them. And they'd be, okay. They'd go from being mad to, you know, it preempted the negativity by letting them know what was coming. And I've seen it work on a regular basis, something about it makes it worse. You could say, you could probably get away with saying this in the Navy, in the teams. You could say, you know, Captain, this is gonna, I don't want you to think I'm being disrespectful and you're probably not gonna get to say the sentence second. Second sentence. Or he's gonna have shut you off. But if instead you said, Captain, I know this is going to sound disrespectful. He'd sit there and listen to you. He'd appreciate being warned. And there's something about that reaction, that tiny little shift, that I learned way back on the hotline. So you worked this suicide hotline for a year? I was actively on the line for probably a little over two years, two and a half years. I stayed very involved. When the first trade center kicked off, then our follow-on case, which was a larger, broader conspiracy on a couple of different groups that were all linked together. Through the course of that following year, I just didn't have time to volunteer on a hotline anymore. Mm-hmm. So this is kind of how you get started in this negotiation, learning this skill. And I kind of told you this before we started recording. We're going to see all kinds of overlap between what I talk about from a leadership perspective. There's a lot of skills that are transferred. It's like if you're good at baseball, there's a lot of things that are going to transfer over to softball. If you're good at wrestling, there's a lot of things that are going to transfer over to softball. If you're good at wrestling, there's a lot of things they're going to transfer over to, you know, jujitsu. So there's a lot of stuff that's really, really similar. And there's some, some differences as well. But this skill of negotiation, as I read through the book, it's evolved a lot in the last 40, 50 years. Right. And, 40, 50 years. And some of the stuff that you talk about in the book, hostage negotiation used to mean stall them until we get a chance to assault. That was what it was. There was a mindset change that you outline in the book that occurred around 1971, October 1971, a guy named George Giff. Am I saying that right? He's a guy that took a plane, took hostages on the plane. The plane lands to refuel. The hostages had actually negotiated their own release, but the FBI got frustrated and shoots the engine of the plane. The guy loses his mind, kills the hostages. The FBI gets sued and actually loses the lawsuit. So all of a sudden they realize they need to make some adjustments to the way they're negotiating. they need to make some adjustments to their the way they're negotiating right uh another thing that you kind of detail in the book is 1979 harvard starts this negotiation project and they're starting to look at negotiation theory and practice they're trying to improve it uh a book ends up coming out of that the book is called getting to yes that was written by roger fisher and william uri who were also the co-founders of that project and and the theory that they had was that look the you know people are emotional and they're animalistic and they're unreliable and they're irrational and you just need to overcome that with rational, logical, problem-solving mindset, which is actually an idea that doesn't turn out to work so well because it""]","When running an international kidnap response, challenges include walking into a hostile environment where local embassy staff feel unwelcome and inadequate due to the presence of someone from Washington, D.C.

How does proactive listening differ from passive listening in terms of gathering information and making the speaker feel listened to?,"["". And you're going to buy in. And that politician never said that. Or you're going to see a video of a politician you don't like. And it's going to reinforce your dislike because it was curated for you. But the media in general does that. You got to take a look at what's being reported that they said versus what did they really say. Right. And that's critical thinking. And it's always been a problem for human beings. Has it always been a problem? Because look, I'm somewhat of a new employer, right? I started running a business. We have about 150 employees. We interview people all the time. We interact in the media. And one of my frustrations is that I feel like discernment and critical thinking is something that's very, very difficult to find. Anybody that works here at PragerU knows that my motto here is we value people who work hard and think critically. Because I've really developed a frustration as an employer with the fact that people are lazy about thinking critically. Or maybe they're not lazy about it, but maybe they can't. Or maybe the educator in me is asking, have we taught American kids how to think critically? And I know that you're an educator too in many ways, right? You Harvard Business School and you give the seminars. How do we teach critical thinking? and you give the seminars. How do we teach critical thinking? I don't know that we've ever taught it well. And really hearing what somebody said. One of the cases in the book, Jeffrey Schilling kidnapping in the Philippines, not quite last century, but it goes down. It starts in August of 2000. And I'm just into the Bureau. So Schilling gets himself kidnapped. He actually walks into the camp of the Abu Sayyaf, the terrorist group. He walks into the camp in the jungle to have an argument with them. I often say that an American getting kidnapped overseas, usually but not always, is because they did something stupid. So shocking that you walk into a terrorist camp and they don't let you go, especially if you went there to argue with them. Okay. So it was an unplanned kidnapping, kidnapping nonetheless, kidnapping of opportunity. The leader of the terrorist group, Schilling's there with his girlfriend. He looks at Schilling, says, you're staying. Looks at the girlfriend, says, you go back to town. She goes back to town and immediately reports to the media, not my cousin is holding my boyfriend in the jungle. The Abu Sayyaf has kidnapped an American. So that's not accurate reporting. Media bites on it right away. The bad guy, Sabaya, has got a very close relationship with many people in the media because terrorism is about media coverage. Sure. So they call him on the phone because they got his number. Now, he's still trying to figure out what to do with this guy Schilling. There's been a recent kidnapping where a bunch of Western Europeans were reportedly ransomed out at a million dollars per. And he says on the phone, well, if a Western European is worth a million dollars, an American has to be worth 10 times that. The media, Manila Star, Abu Sayyaf demands $10 million for Jeffrey Schilling. Now, that is not what he said. Now, if we got into that negotiation going on what was reported in the media, I've already shown him that I'm not listening and I'm stupid. So we took a look at what was in the paper and then we got back and we drilled into it and we started with what did he actually say? Now this is 20 years ago. So that problem existed 20 years ago. It probably existed 20, lack of critical thinking, lack of listening, probably existed 20 years before that and 20 years before that. I think now media and social media is an accelerator. We see it faster and sooner. I don't know that it's new. Is that part of some of the courses that you teach? The act of listening is really how to, in the course of communication, can I go back over the conversation with you so that instead of it feeling redundant to you, you actually feel better and more listened to, where I'm actually just checking the information. Checking for understanding. That's the educational term. Yeah. Yeah. I'm engaged in a process of critical thinking. I got to know what you really said based on the way the brain works. If I only listened and never spoke, I still wouldn't hear everything. Every time I speak, I'm going to miss what you just said. Every time I stop to think about what you just said, if you're still talking, I'm going to miss everything that you say in that moment. So passive listening is highly inefficient. Proactive listening is me gathering more information from you without making you feel interrogated. You actually like it.

What trait helps salespeople succeed?,"["" thing. You know, it's fun to help people tackle new things in life. So walk us through your journey on getting into this space. Obviously, you had one of the best coaches out there right at home to kind of deliver some of this information to you. I'm sure you grew up around it. But talk us through how did you end up making the decision that this is something I want to invest my life in? Well, to kind of answer the first part in regards to a mentor, definitely lucky, blessed. I mean, there's a plethora of words you can come up with to describe how lucky I am to be in this situation. And I got to tell you, my dad's still my dad. And while he was tough on me, it's still his job to encourage and things like that. And so I got to admit, I learned a lot of tough lessons outside the home, just like a lot of people did. And dad was there to be supportive all the way through. And great person. I got a sounding board. I need to talk through this thing. Who can I bounce this off of? It's my father. That was a cool thing. But sales, early on in sales, going door to door, pushing Verizon's name, that was starting out like doing that. There's a certain grit that door to door sales gets you that I think you can't really earn it anywhere else. Yeah. gets you that I think it's, you can't really earn it anywhere else. And it's so interesting to talk to top level salespeople now that want to discuss their early days going door to door and getting past the no solicitation signs and grumpy people and there's something to that. And so yeah, definitely learned a lot doing that. And I've always enjoyed people, just personally. I like to people watch. I like, just personally, right? I like to people watch. I like to, I like to see how people operate. I like to see how they carry themselves. You know, it's just, it's fascinating. People are, people are so interesting. And so sales came naturally in a lot of ways, just because I like to interact. And then, you know, you start coupling, you know, the love the love for working with people and then getting agreements to move forward and agreements that make everybody happy, right? Agreements where everybody's making money on the back end. And you combine that with the level of communication from a guy like Chris Voss, and it's just, it's fun, man. And it's a learning experience every day. I don't know if I'll ever be as good as I, as I should be, but you know, just trying to get better all the time, you know? But that's that, that's that mindset of you want to continue to grow and continue to progress. If somebody was, you were going to give somebody some advice and they're maybe early in their career, they're a young gunner, or there's somebody who's been doing something else for a really long time, and they want to get good at sales. They want to get good at this. Where should they start, and who should they model? Wow, that's a good question. Well, first of all, I got to get the book, right? Go check it out. That Never Split the Difference book. To be in sales, it takes a certain amount. You got to have a thick skin to be in sales. If you've ever been in it in any capacity, you know that it takes a thick skin. And staying, as Derek Gaunt would like to say, staying cognitively flexible as a salesperson is tough. Because you generally got quotas to meet. God forbid if you're commission only sales, then you're in a whole new boat, right? You got an unlimited ceiling, but there ain't no floor either. That's one of those things, right? But people don't like you just because you're in sales. Initial impressions for a salesperson are almost always bad just because you're always fighting it uphill. I'm a salesperson are almost always bad just because you're always fighting it uphill. I'm a salesperson battle. And so, you know, things, and I can't think of the guy's name, Wolf of Wall Street, you know, things that he talks about are essential for mindset. And so, you know, that's, and then Kiyosaki, I can't think, Rich Dad, Poor Dad, you know, that's and then Kiyosaki, I can't think Rich Dad, Poor Dad, you know, those are good places to start looking early on if you're early in your sales career. Jordan Belfort from Wolf of Wall Street is who you're thinking of? Exactly, yeah, Jordan Belfort. Exactly right. Yeah, there's certain the guy's got grit.

Why did Kahneman win the 2002 Econ Nobel?,"[' valuable information. A win-win.\nLaw #3: Labeling Negatives Diffuses Them, Labeling Positives Reinforces Them\nPicture yourself walking into a negotiation. You’re meeting with a client who sounded unhappy in their last email exchange, but they didn’t describe the issue. You open the door, not sure what to expect, and a palpable wave of tension and unease hits you. \nInstead of letting the negativity suffocate the negotiation, you say, “It seems like you’re upset about something.”\n\n“Yes! We weren’t happy with how the last report came out,” your counterpart blurts. \n\nThe conversation shifts to how you can fix the problem, and like a cloud of poisonous gas, the negativity diffuses and clears away. Everyone in the room can breathe again.\n\nLabeling is a powerful skill for influencing your counterpart’s emotional state. By labeling negative emotions, you diffuse them. By labeling positive emotions, you reinforce them.\nThe Law in Action\nPositives and negatives are two sides of the same coin. When you’re thinking of a label to use in a given situation, a good place to start is to name a positive emotion and its corresponding negative emotion.\n“It sounds like you love organization,” or, “It sounds like you hate chaos.” \n“It seems like you enjoy keeping your options open,” or, “It seems like you dislike feeling limited in your choices.”\n“It looks like you’d be more comfortable going in a different direction,” or, “It looks like you’re uncomfortable with this direction.”\n\nWhether you focus on reinforcing the positive or defusing the negative, you can expect one of two responses from your counterpart: “That’s right,” or a correction. If you hear, “That’s right,” you’re showing your counterpart that you understand them. If you get a correction, you’ve gained valuable information. Both improve your relationship with your counterpart.\nLaw #4: Loss Looms Larger Than Gain\nIn 1979, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky developed prospect theory, work that went on to win Kahneman the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics. The theory describes how people disproportionately feel the pain of loss more intensely than the joy of gain. \n\nThe researchers’ studies showed how some participants needed to earn $2000 to counteract the negative emotions of a $1000 loss. As Kahneman and Tversky summarized, “Loss looms larger than gain.”\n\nA Georgetown student of mine worked for a company that sold retirement benefits to companies, and the core question they had to answer was, “How do you give somebody golden handcuffs?”\n\nThey wanted to communicate that the benefits of staying at a company were too good for employees to leave. Most insurance companies pitch gain: “We’ll bring you a 20 percent better rate of return for your investments.”\n\nThe student’s company took a different approach. “Let us view your benefits package and we’ll give you an idea of whether or not we can improve it,” they would say. Then they’d come back and describe the difference in this way: “Do nothing and stay with your current benefits provider, and it’s going to cost you 20 percent every day. When you go to bed at night, it will cost you. When you wake up in the morning, it will cost you.”\n\nThey pitched loss, and in doing so they found they achieved a much higher selling rate than the companies that pitched gain.\n\nHuman nature is never going to change. Technology can change, and the circumstances can change. We’re going to have pandemics, wars, and recessions. But no matter what’s going on, the fear of loss will always be the single biggest driver of human decision-making. This wiring in our heads is the point from which we all start, and it’s not going to change. \nThe Law in Action\nPeople are afraid to change because they think, If I change, what am I going to lose?\n\nIf instead you communicate to them, “You lose by doing nothing,” like my insurance-selling student, you stimulate people into deciding to change. \n\nIn other words, to make a deal, your counterpart’s fear of the status quo must be greater than their fear of change. People will more willingly take a risk to avoid a loss than they will to accomplish a gain. Your goal is to help them realize, This is risky, but doing nothing will cost us more.\n\nThe caveat here is that you’re']","Kahneman won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on prospect theory, which describes how people disproportionately feel the pain of loss more intensely than the joy of gain.",reasoning,"[{'int_id': '239', 'kind': 'book', 'row': 238, 'source': 'util/live_dataset.csv', 'title': 'How Am I Supposed To Do That?'}]",True,"['Danny Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in 2002, behavioral economics, prospect theory.'

Why does 'No' give control in negotiations?,"[' nice and to respect  people’s feelings \nat all times and in every situation.\nBut  nice  alone  in  the  context  of  negotiation  can  backfire.  Nice, \nemployed  as  a  ruse,  is  disingenuous  and  manipulative.  Who  hasn’t \nreceived the short end of the stick in dealings with a “nice” salesman \nwho  took  you  for  a  ride?  If  you  rush  in  with  plastic  niceness,  your \nbland smile is going to dredge up all that baggage.\nInstead of getting inside with logic or feigned smiles, then, we get \nthere by asking for “No.” It’s the word that gives the speaker feelings of \nsafety and control. “No” starts conversations and creates safe havens \nto get to the final “Yes” of commitment. An early “Yes” is often just a \ncheap, counterfeit dodge.\nAbout five months after she’d told me to “go away,” I stopped by Amy \nBonderow’s office and told her that I’d volunteered at HelpLine.\n“You did?” she asked, smiling with surprise. “I tell everybody to do \nthat. And nobody ever does.”\nIt turned out that Amy had started her negotiating career by vol-\nunteering at the same place. She started naming  people who were now \nmutual friends of ours. We laughed about Jim.\nIn a sudden shift, Amy stopped speaking and stared at me. I shifted \nin my shoes as she gave me the Pause. Then she smiled.\n“You get the next position.”\nAt that time, there were five other  people aiming for the same slot, \n people who had psychology degrees, experience, and credentials. But \nI was on the road to the next hostage negotiation training course at \nthe FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, ahead of everybody else. My \ncareer as a negotiator had officially begun.\n“NO” IS PROTECTION\nThink back to the telemarketer at the beginning of this chapter. The \nobvious reply to his question— “Do you enjoy a nice glass of water?”— is \n“Yes.” But all you want to do is scream, “No!” After a question like that \nyou just know the rest of the phone call is going to be painful.\nThat, in a nutshell, distills the inherent contradictions in the values \nwe give “Yes” and “No.” Whenever we negotiate, there’s no doubt we \nwant to finish with a “Yes.” But we mistakenly conflate the positive \nvalue of that final “Yes” with a positive value of “Yes” in general. And \nbecause  we  see  “No”  as  the  opposite  of  “Yes,”  we  then  assume  that \n“No” is always a bad thing.\nNothing  could  be  further  from  the  truth.  Saying  “No”  gives  the \nspeaker  the  feeling  of  safety,  security,  and  control.  You  use  a  ques-\ntion that prompts a “No” answer, and your counterpart feels that by \nturning you down he has proved that he’s in the driver’s seat. Good \nnegotiators welcome— even invite— a solid “No” to start, as a sign that \nthe other party is engaged and thinking.\nGun for a “Yes” straight off the bat, though, and your counterpart \ngets defensive, wary, and skittish. That’s why I tell my students that, \nif you’re trying to sell something, don’t start with “Do you have a few \nminutes to talk?” Instead ask, “Is now a bad time to talk?” Either you \nget “Yes, it is a bad time” followed by a good time or a request to go \naway, or you get “No, it’s not” and total focus.\nAs  an  exercise,  the  next  time  you  get  a  telemarketing  call,  write \ndown the questions the seller asks.

How can predictable communication ease emotions in real estate talks?,"["" real estate agent? Well, let's change the word constant and let's make it predictable. It should be continuous, but it should be predictable. Most people only communicate when they have good news or bad. When are you going to have good news or bad news? You don't know, which makes your communication unpredictable. And then if you got bad news, you sit on it for a day, two days, three days, hoping it'll disappear, hoping that you'll come up with a better answer, hoping that the angels will come down and save you. The cavalry is going to come over the hill, hoping it goes away. Again, you're unpredictable. So set times, specific times as to when you're going to talk, no matter what. And if they're sitting back there waiting on you while you're waiting on good news, you're increasing the anxiety and the friction and the negativity in the relationship. So reach out to them and say, just want you to know there's nothing new. You're going to hear from me Wednesday at 10 a.m. Don't say you're going to hear from me by the end of the week. Say you'll hear from me to close a business on Friday. Make your communication eminently predictable because what you say and what they hear are two different things. I'm coaching a guy through a negotiation a couple of years ago. He said, the client promised to get back to me first quarter. So I'm expecting to hear from them in January. And I thought, they're not going to talk to you until the last day of March. That's the kind of anxiety that vagueness gives in communication. Tell people exactly when to expect to hear from you and then stick to that. And if you don't have anything to report, no progress, communicate and say, look, just so you know, so you're updated, so you're informed, so far, no progress. They're going to find that tremendously reassuring. Yeah, fantastic suggestions. This is fire information. I appreciate it very much. In dealing with the negotiation process, particularly in real estate, people can become emotional because they are their biggest could say, adversarial, right? When dealing with that, when something becomes emotional quickly, what can you do to diffuse the situation? You know, the late night FM DJ voice to start with. Yeah. First of all, it calms both of you down. I mean, there's a neurochemical calming reaction. It's involuntary. As you're calming them down, smile when you get the opportunity, because you're looking for a couple mental shifts. You're looking to shift them out of anger. You know, Jordan Belfort, I study everybody. Wolf of Wall Street, the way of the wolf. He's got great tonality. You know, he'll say, well, match their emotion and and once you match it then then bring them down and my thought is why waste time matching why don't you just go ahead and bring them down you know just go ahead and start with the late night fm dj boys so we used an hostage negotiation we didn't have arguments with terrorists and kidnappers we started out that way you know imagine somebody found kaiaeda screaming at me on the phone, and I start screaming back to try to match him, show him I'm like him. No, we didn't even bother with that. We just went ahead and went to the late night FM DJ voice and brought people down. There are fewer arguments with terrorists than there are in business. How does that happen? Yeah. We started with the late night FM DJ voice from the very beginning. Interesting. Yeah, late night. We got to implement it. Listen more. Slow down. Use the late night DJ FM voice to diffuse the situation. How do you know when it's time to walk away from a negotiation? I diagnose that real early on. Like I find out, are they playing me? Everybody in my company within the first 10 minutes, we're going to get a good feel for number one. Are you playing me for the fool entirely? Or are you just only going to do business with me if you can cut my throat? I can figure that out really quickly. It's not a sin to not get the deal. It's a sin to take a long time to not get the deal. It's also a sin to take a long time to get a bad deal. So when there's friction early on, when people are super hyper focused on only one aspect of the deal, if they are overboard with how great the opportunity is, I know where this is going. I listen to my gut. And so we pull out of deals, conversations really, really early. We let people know that we will always be there when they want to collaborate, when they want to make a commitment, when they want to have a long-term relationship.

But your chances of encountering a person like that who won't move off of that position is drastically reduced if you first take the time to explain to them that you understand where they're coming from, what their perspective is. Okay. So let me give you an example here. So let's say that we're sticking with the panel situation here. So it's a holiday weekend. We do a panel install. Let me change it up a little bit. It's a holiday weekend and their electricity goes out. And so they call around and guess what? The only people that answer the phones are us. So we dispatch an electrician. He goes out on site and he makes some modifications, et cetera, et cetera. And then Monday morning rolls around and buyer's remorse sets in and we're getting the phone call or the other technicians going out or whatever. And the person is saying like, well, you weren't really my favorite. You were just the only person to answer the phone. And this is way too much. And like, I can't believe this and et cetera, et cetera. You know, I'd rather use somebody else. So where do we find ourselves in those situations when the attacks are like, well, I wasn't going to use you, but I couldn't find anybody else. So I had to. And this is after you've already done, after you've already done work for them right so you know in a scenario like that like let's take hvac right so holiday weekend uh they're sweating in their house or they're freezing in their house and we're the only ones that answer the phone we're the only ones that come out we're the only ones that service them and then monday morning rolls around and they're upset about the price or they called six other people and they give them some ballpark information over the phone and now they're calling us again saying like, this is crazy, et cetera. All right. So how are you different from the other six people that they call? You're different because you answered the phone. You're different because you came out. You've already shown them, you've already demonstrated for them that they are a priority for you so when your tech goes out and they're hit with that their first their first reaction should not be oh what a jerk your first reaction should be your first reaction should be, where is this coming from? Stay curious. Dosiecki's new slogan is, stay curious, my friends. Stay curious, my friends. See, we get wrapped around the axle because they say, well, you're the only ones that answered the phone, and you came out, you weren't my favorite, and I think you guys cost too much money. What are they actually saying to that? Or with those words, I should say, what are they actually saying? The service level, you're too, we didn't really want you. You don't want to answer the phone, and you cost too much money. What are they actually saying to that, saying to you? I mean, they're frustrated that it happened in a time and situation that nobody else was able to serve them, I guess. Boom. That's what you lead with. It sounds like this situation has you completely frustrated. Not only were you frustrated by the fact that you couldn't get an answer until you got to us, you're frustrated by the fact that you sat in your house all weekend and you were sweating.

How can women lower their voice octave?,"["" the child down. The question I get the most about that is, how does a woman do the late night FM DJ voice? To get to that lower octave sometimes it can be challenging. What I tell women to do is relax their shoulders, take a deep breath, relax down the whole diaphragm here, tilt the chin down, and you will automatically notice that your voice gets lower. My suggestion is that you take the time to record yourself talking in the different voices so that you can hear the difference. Practice enunciating your words, lowering the octave of your voice, and then you should be able to do it successfully.\n\nAt the police department, there were times when I would go on a call and I would be in my what we call beat area-- so it was my turn to handle this call. it was my responsibility, and a male officer would be sent as my backup. We'd walk into the house or the apartment or wherever we were, and the people would automatically start talking to the male officer. Luckily for me, the majority of the people I worked with would say I'm sorry, you're going to have to talk to her, and they would send them right to me. But there were occasions when I would be working with a different set of officers that wouldn't do that. They would just take over the call, and that didn't help. If there's someone who will speak up for you to be your protector so to speak, by saying, hey, don't talk to her that way or hey, you should listen to her, it's nice of them to do that, but at the same time they're fighting your battles for you. What would be better is if you know there's someone in your corner who is a protector, approach them about being your advocate instead. Say, look, I appreciate everything you do helping me out, trying to help my voice be heard. Would it be impossible for you to just segue me into the conversation somehow-- even as simple as saying, hey, Sandy, what do you think about that, and let me talk.

How does labeling emotions calm the amygdala?,"["" the hotline might make. So write down what you think a good response is. They're going to give you back this piece of paper at the end of the training. They give you back the piece of paper at the end of the training. Now, I write like it looks like I write with my feet. My handwriting is very distinct. Like there's no way you can fake my handwriting. So they hand me this piece of paper and I know that's my handwriting. And I remember thinking like, what moron wrote those responses? That was how far they'd take you in two months and you don't even know it. What's an example of what you instinctively might think you should say to what you actually should say. So one call that I did get, this guy calls in and says, look, I'm just trying to put a lid on this night. I'm trying to put a lid on this night. Now before training, I might have said, have you tried watching some TV? Have you tried working out? Like when I'm have said, have you tried watching some TV? Have you tried working out? Like when I'm really stressed, I know if I go get a good workout, it clears my head. Or have you tried meditation? Like jumping right in to problem solving. That is the wrong way to do it. That will prolong the situation. Like the speed accelerator which is neuroscience based i didn't know at the time is to deactivate the negatives by calling them out so i just say to this guy because i've been taught to just like call out what you're hearing so i go he sounded frantic so i said sound frantic and immediately his voice started coming down several notches instantaneously and that that tiny like people listen to that conversation would be like what he the guy what he just said seems unhelpful mm-hmm however if I'm watching the person that he said it to, instantaneously came down. And since you don't see examples of that in real life or on the movies or TV, on the movies or TV, the guy would say, look, have you tried working out? And then on the movies or TV, they'll depict it as the other person saying, like, wow, that's a great idea. I'll do that. So what's psychologically going through my head when I tell you I want to put a cap on this night, I got to put a cap on this night, and you say back to me, you sound like you're frantic. What's going through my head that's making me de-escalate? Right. So it's probably a neurochemical reaction. what's going through my head that's making me de-escalate? Right. So it's probably a neurochemical reaction. And from listening to Hubrum and others, I'm fascinated by finding the science behind it. It's been duplicated in a number of experiments that if I put you in an fMRI, where I can watch the electricity moving around in your brain and I show you a picture that induces some sort of negative thought and what the picture is it doesn't matter the experiment's been done a number of times they might have shown them puppies in the rain a starving child in Africa anything that induce a negative thought. And so seeing the picture, they watch areas in your brain light up that either for you or predicted in advance where the negativity in your brain is housed. That bounces around a little bit based on person, but it's essentially about three-quarters of the amygdala and a couple of other things that are involved. So they watch it light up when you see the picture. Now they just say to you, what are you feeling? Just asking you to label it, call it out, simply call it out. And every time they ask a person to simply identify the negative emotion that they're feeling, the electrical activity in the areas that it lit up start to diminish. Every time. Not sometimes, start to diminish. Every time. Not sometimes, not 75% of the time, every time. Now, the amount they diminish changes, which is why I happened to hit the nail on the head with this guy on a hotline. He starts coming down significantly. Sometimes you can call out somebody's negative emotion and there won't be any perceivable response. It doesn't mean it didn't work. It means you just need to do it some more. But it happens every time. Now, what triggers it is, is it a neurochemical response? Is it a conscious response? It's probably some sort of neurochemical response. But what we learned in hostage negotiation and on the hotline, actually, we do this extremely aggressively now in all our business negotiations. Like, you know, I guess something contentious to talk about. I'm going to call you on a phone, send you a text, send you an email saying like, yeah, I don't like what I have to say.

How does the amygdala affect coping with bad news?,"[' accusations on it until the person they\'re talking to says, all right, hold it, hold it, hold it. Where is this going? What do you want? That\'s the indicator that they\'re ready to hear the bad news. Bad news is effectively emotional pain. There\'s some really good neuroscience out there these days that people cope with pain better if warned. And there\'s pretty much an effective window somewhere between three and 40 seconds roughly your accusations are it may continue 26 items. Does that mean that you have to do all 26 at once? Well, if they don\'t stop you. Means you\'re on the right track that you should keep going. One of the reasons for the read in the moment is to be able to gauge their reaction in the moment, in the effective window of bracing people for pain, also known as bad news. Read them in the moment, watch to see how they\'re reacting. Could be based on a lot of factors-- How much sleep they got last night; how much stress they\'re under at the moment; how tired they are; their circadian rhythm; what they had to eat. Start your accusations audit. Deliver three to five of them, read it in the moment, and keep going as needed. They\'ll give you the feedback you need to where you want to be. Where you really want to be is hold it, hold it, hold it. What\'s going on here? Which is them beginning to step to your side. It\'s beginning to be less of an adversarial situation, which is really what you\'re after, long-term collaboration, long-term collaboration with the employee, that employees trust, them understanding that you know where they\'re coming from by your articulation of what the negatives are. This understanding actually relieves a tremendous amount of pressure on them. Actually makes them less in a need for the time off. Because if people need time off, they need to unwind. They feel stressed. They need to renew. They need to recharge. If they\'re not getting into at work, they\'re not getting enough of it. This process, by definition, helps put them in a better place. The other part is because they have an amygdala, a limbic system, an emotional reaction system that has a tendency to overreact to bad news, when you finally deliver what your bad news is, it might actually be a relief. They may be worried that they\'re going to get fired. And when you tell them they can\'t have the time off, they\'re actually relieved. The interesting thing about this is where you leave people is the most important aspect of your communication. You want to leave them in the best place possible. There\'s a saying out there ""leave people better than you found them."" Somebody\'s come to you for requests for time off, which you can\'t grant. Your real issue is how are you going to leave them in your response to this request? How do you leave them better than you found them? In the denial of their request, your job as a supervisor is to at least diminish and deactivate as much of the negativity and the stress that they\'re dealing with as possible. Some of the stress of work is people wonder whether or not they\'re appreciated. You can say, I appreciate you, which has some impact. Or you can say, you probably feel I don\'t appreciate you, which has more impact.\nid: 6d9695046709fee0\nmetadata: {\'kind\': \'lesson\', \'parent_title\': \'Win Workplace Negotiations\', \'publisher\': \'MasterClass\', \'title\': \'Interactive Practice Using The Accusation Audit At Work\', \'url\': \'https://www.masterclass.com/\'}']","The amygdala, part of the limbic system, has an emotional reaction system that tends to overreact to bad news.

How does tactical empathy gain from letting others speak first?,"["" so those are the two main things. I mean, another another part of this is being willing to experiment. You know, some of it is just like, again, along the lines, you're not always going to get it right. However, every time that you do a misstep or you accidentally do get it right, you're taking very conscious notes of what sort of reactions people are giving you. And then those repetitions and those cycles, those consistencies will reveal themselves in future conversations. And you'll know what to do. Because when I first tried this, this was the same look I got. And I know I need to follow up with an accusations order. I need to summarize at this moment, your brain will automatically pick up those triggers and make you a better and better communicator the more cycles you get in. There are some fantastic tips. And I just, I suppose, are there anything else that people, is there anything that surprises you when you're doing your coaching and your training about people who are coming to this for the first time anything you think yeah there is yeah you know there is a couple the first one is it's always a telltale sign when we're working with a new client is if their approach is just tell me how to get them to listen to what i have to say right if we start with a coaching client and that's their approach, just tell me how to get them to understand me, then it gives us a good indicator of where we need to start with them on the journey and it really comes from the mental aspect. If your approach is, how do I get them to listen to me, then you're already in the wrong mindset. That's the mindset that we would trip up on because we're still self-focused because it's all about how do I get my point across? How do I get them to understand where I'm coming from? And the nature of tactical empathy and empathy in general is that you allow the other person to go first. You know, this, I hate to refer to it as like a common courtesy, but very much like when you're going through a doorway and you're being courteous and it in you realize that the net gain in allowing to go first takes you a lot further in the short and long term because it's like oh you're allowing me to express my opinions and my thoughts in a very deep manner most people i deal with don't allow that because they're too busy shoving their own data down my throat. And just it's a breath of fresh air to deal with. Yeah. So we instantly start to trigger more and more in-depth thinking and collaboration as a result of that just simple process up front. I'm going to allow you to go first. And then kind of another thing is this idea of listening. We all think that listening is a good thing. And it is. I'm not contending that it's a bad thing. The reality of it is it's not the finish line. And I think that's where we get caught up because it's like, okay, I've listened. You got done talking. I listened because my mouth was shut and my ears were open. Now I can speak. And that's technically not the sequence. After we listen, we need to be able to indicate to them that we fully understand. And that's the next step. And we tend to skip over that because we listen, we say, I understand. And then we go on to what we have to say, as opposed to listening, doing a full summary. Right? So far, you've told me that one of the reasons this house is so important to you is because you and your grandmother drank iced tea on the back deck every summer and uh you know you had your first dog in this house right whatever those things are and as a result you feel like you're losing that by selling this home and that's something that's really hard for you to deal with as opposed to they lay that all that out for you. You just go, oh, I understand. I love my grandmother, too. Now, let me tell you why the market doesn't bear the price that you want. Yeah. Right. And we want to do the former as opposed to the latter. Yeah, I think that's so important that you, you know, like that phrase used about sequencing, because I think most people would go from the listing to straight to trying to fix the problem or, or, you know, just share whatever they're up to. So, um, yeah, I think that's really important, making sure that you've got that empathy in there straight after the listening part, kind of extending that to, uh, to then be able to go on to helping them and, um, uh, and offering solutions. But that is like much later down the line and a lot of people i guess just start with the solutions so they don't even do the listing right yeah yeah is it there's a guy on our""]","Tactical empathy gains from letting others speak first because it allows the other person to express their opinions and thoughts in a deep manner, which most people don't experience because others are often too focused on getting their own points across.

How does knowing negotiator types help in tough talks?,"[' reactive biases. While our negative biases help keep us alive by helping us avoid danger, they can also keep us from making progress in key life moments and relationships. AAs are designed to eliminate the negatives and help set the framework for moving the conversation forward. As highlighted in the SWAT committee example, using AAs at the beginning of your difficult conversation will pave the way for a better outcome. \nDon’t be afraid to skip the pleasantries and small talk and jump right into an AA to attack the negatives. These negatives are the product of fear. As long as there is a remote feeling of fear or that you are a threat, dialogue is less likely to take place and lead in a positive direction. \nYou are a smart person. You know your employees and coworkers well enough that you can probably predict the emotion or response you are likely to receive. It gives you a tremendous advantage when you address the negatives before you get into your presenting your case. \nAssertives, Accommodators, Analysts\nMost of us view ourselves as cerebral, logical, and smart. One of the most debilitating assumptions that we make is that we are “normal” and that others are not. Our hypothesis is that the world should look to our employees as it looks to us. We believe they want to be treated the way we want to be treated. \nStop it!\nDon’t treat them the way you want to be treated. Treat them as they want to be treated. Because there are three “negotiator” personality types within the Black Swan Method, two out of three employees or coworkers you deal with see themselves as the “normal” one, not you. This means there is a minimum 66 percent chance the person you engage within a difficult conversation has an approach to conflict vastly different from yours. \nWhen we think, “I am normal,” we unconsciously project our own ideals and sensibilities on other people, including our employees. \nFor example, you say to yourself that because you like pepperoni pizza, others should also like pepperoni pizza. It only makes sense, right? Pepperoni is delicious! \nWrong! \nWhat is “normal” is unique to the individual. \nRecognizing which type you are and the type you are dealing with will help you appreciate their definition of “normal.” \nAt the BSG, we have conducted an exercise for businesspeople all over the globe. The exercise involves exposing them to our three negotiator personality types. Then, upon introspection, they place themselves into one of the categories. Without fail we have found that each group splits fairly neatly into thirds. \nThe first type is strongly predisposed to being heard and respected and competing to win at all costs. They have an aggressive communication style and low regard for future relationships. \nThe second type gets tremendous satisfaction from relationships. Having others like them is more important than accomplishments. \nThe third type is a reserved problem-solver, more concerned with data and information. They don’t slink away from conflict, but they consider it largely a waste of time. Tell them what the issue is, and they would much prefer to fly solo in coming up with a solution. \nLet’s take a look at each more closely.\nIdentifying Their Type\nHow do you identify each type? When you have skin in the game, the pressure is on, or you feel you are getting backed into a corner or attacked, what is your default type? As I lay out the characteristics of each, consider which best fits your human-nature response. \nHere is a story that may help you decide which one you are.\nImagine your conflict is a giant grizzly bear. You are hiking in the woods and come across this bear. He’s sitting on the path you are walking on. You see him. He sees you. The Assertive unsheathes a large hunting knife and says to herself, “I may not win this one, but at the end, this bear is going to know he has been in a fight.” \nThe Analyst pulls out his GPS unit and begins to scroll through the different escape paths off the main one that he entered prior to the hike for an emergency like this. He ducks behind a tree, selects a path, and moves deeper into the bush. He finds a tree to climb, removes a rifle from his pack, and shoots the bear from a distance. \nThe Accommodator approaches the bear with arms extended and says, “There, there little fella. You know what your problem is? No one understood you as a cub. I’m gonna take you home, clean you up, and introduce you to my family.” Understanding your negotiator conflict management personality is critical to navigating difficult conversations. \nI am not suggesting you should or can change your personality. You are who you are.']",Knowing negotiator types helps in tough talks by allowing you to appreciate their definition of 'normal' and tailor your approach accordingly.

How do tone and labeling affect question reception in negotiations with defensive counterparts?,"["", you're going to throw a little bit of empathy, at least at the beginning of it along the lines of maybe a miniature accusations on it. This is going to sound harsh. Or it's going to sound selfish and self-centered. Again, it's not how it is. It's how it seems to them. So you could say, this is going to sound selfish. How am I supposed to continue working for you if I'm not getting paid? Now, the way I said it just now was with a downward inflection at the end. Or you could say it with an upward inflection, a slight use of dynamic silence just before you end the question. And I'll do it for you. How am I supposed to continue working for you if I'm not getting paid? Slight dynamic silence just before the punch line, if you will, of the question delivered with genuine curiosity. That's a legitimate question. It's asked in a deferential manner with even more deference at the end or genuine curiosity at the end. Try that type of a question both ways. Both ways will yield positive results and different results. And you'll develop your instinct of which one you want in the moment through the actual use of the question. So the bad way of saying that would be through tone of voice. And again, your inner voice betrays your outer voice. So if you think that someone should expect you to keep working when you're not getting paid is an idiot, that's going to betray your voice if you say it like that. How am I supposed to keep working for you if I'm not getting paid? That tone of voice says, I think you're an idiot, at least. And that's not the impact you want to have. So you can see how you can completely change the way a question lands with your tone of voice. One, it creates defensiveness. The other one, it creates understanding.\n\nWherever you were in the world, when you were a little kid, you're a little toddler, you're walking around, you don't know any better, you reach up. You knock something over. And the nearest adult to you pointed at you and said, why did you do that? So you started getting drilled into your head early, no matter where you were in the world, then when somebody was asking you why you did something that you made a mistake. So you were nurtured that this is an accusation of wrongdoing. Now the flip side problem of this as adults. You often ask somebody why because you really want to know. But the other half of the time, you and everybody else when somebody does something wrong as an adult, the first thing you're going to say is, why did you do that? So people, again, are so conditioned that when they're being asked why that it's automatically an accusation of wrongdoing. And you're going to trigger a negative response every single time. One of the advantages that I've had as a negotiator who's literally negotiated in every continent on Earth, I've seen universally whenever somebody inadvertently asked the counterpart, whether it was a terrorist or a CEO, why, the other person at least got defensive, and in many cases, completely blew up. So I'm not making this up because I think this is the case.

 "" direct questions altogether unless we're trying to get the person to start problem solving or we're trying to shape their thinking. And we are now using labels, asking labels to get the same information. Instead of saying, why did you do that? Why haven't you paid us yet? For example, turning it into an asking label takes the sting out of it. It seems like there's a reason why we haven't been paid yet. People want other people to understand their circumstance, what they're going through, how they feel, and ferreting that information out with an asking label. Removes the defensiveness.

And so you automatically, a full third of the population, you already are putting them in a negative mindset. And when people are in a negative mindset, they are dumber than they otherwise should be. Your brain works up to 31% better when you're in a positive state. So when I'm interacting with someone that I'm trying to influence, I want them to be as cognitively nimble as possible. So I want to take care of all the negatives that they already have. And I certainly don't want to introduce any new negatives into the equation. Interesting. And I know one of the ways to ensure that you label properly is to start your sentences with a couple of different phrases. It seems like, it feels like, it sounds like, and by doing so, like you said, you remove yourself from the situation. What if you label something and it's not correct? It seems like you're upset and the person goes, no, no, I'm not angry. I'm not upset. What would you say to do in a situation like that? I would say tap, pat yourself on the back because you just got smart. You tested a theory that you had and you found out it was incorrect. You tested a theory that you had and you found out it was incorrect. When is being provided new information ever a bad thing? To your point, most people are worried about labeling it wrong and offending the other person. And the reality is one of the laws of negotiation gravity is the desire to correct is irresistible. People can't wait to tell you that you got it wrong because it puts them in a position of superiority over you, even if it's just for a brief second. But the correction feels so good that they ignore what they're actually sharing with you. Even if it compromises their position, it doesn't matter to them because in that moment, your correction feels so good that they're like, they're not even worried about the fact that they just gave you the information that they probably shouldn't have given you. And so in pursuit of that, there are oftentimes when we will intentionally mislabel. We'll tell our coaching clients, we want you to intentionally mislabel the circumstance because in that correction that they're going to give you, it's unguarded, it's unvarnished, and it's as close to the absolute truth as you're going to get. Hmm. What would a mislabel look like? You just said it. Just label something totally that you think they wouldn't be feeling. Yeah. You just said it. You just said it. You said you sound angry. And the guy says, no, I'm not angry. I'm whatever. I'm frustrated. I feel like I've been portrayed. That's the truth of what's motivating their behavior. And look, you're on safe ground because you're not making anything up out of whole cloth. You're telling me this is the data you're giving me, pal. I'm not making this up. That's why I said it seems like. I didn't say you were. I said it seems like. I like that. That's awesome. And I guess this also is really powerful when you use it with accusation audits. I was thinking about how this would apply to a younger person. For example, maybe they're approaching their teacher to try and get an extension for an assignment. And I want you to take on the role, Derek, because if you were a student right now, walking up to your teacher, try and ask for an extension on an assignment. How could you use up to your teacher, try and ask for an extension on an assignment. How could you use accusation audits, labeling, calibrated questions all together to increase the probability of your teacher saying, yes, I'll give you an extra day or two on an assignment? All right. So the first thing you need to do before you approach the teacher is to say to yourself, if I were them, what would I be thinking about me? What would I be thinking about this request? Because at the end of the day, whenever you ask anybody to do anything, you are in essence, putting more work on their plate, regardless of what the""]","Tone and labeling significantly affect question reception in negotiations with defensive counterparts. Using a deferential tone and dynamic silence can create understanding rather than defensiveness. Labeling, such as starting sentences with 'it seems like,' 'it feels like,' or 'it sounds like,' helps remove defensiveness and encourages the counterpart to share information more openly. Mislabeling intentionally can also elicit unguarded and truthful responses.",multi_context,"[{'int_id': '199', 'kind': 'lesson', 'row': 198, 'source': 'util/live_dataset.csv', 'title': 'Skill Introduction Calibrated Questions'}

How does labeling emotions affect amygdala activity in negative states?,"[': 133\ncontent: The amygdala is this little organ in the middle of your head, and it is the nerve center of all the emotions. There were neuroscience experiments that were done where they put people in fMRIs, functional magnetic resonance imaging equipment, so they could watch the electrical activity in people\'s brains. Then they induced the negative emotion by showing a photo to them. The photo might make them feel sad, angry, lonely, hurt, upset. They knew the photo would trigger some sort of a negative emotion. They showed the people the photo, and they simply said, what are you feeling? They told them to identify it or label it. And every time that the person self-labeled, they saw the electrical activity in the negative part of the amygdala decrease, every time. Now, when we first started on labels in a hostage negotiation, we called them emotion labels, and we used it as a very self-defining skill. You labeled emotions. You heard an emotion, put a label on it. If somebody sounded angry, you said, you sound angry. And if that negative emotion is there, that label will reduce that negative emotion. So in this session, I\'m going to teach you about labels. Labels are just verbal observations. When I first came out of hostage negotiation into business negotiation, I actually thought this was the least important skill on our list. Having been involved in business negotiation for quite a while and coaching a lot of people, we found out that labels might be the most important skill, the most innocuous skill, and the most MacGyver skill, the most useful tool with the most different applications to unwind and solve some of the trickiest problems. Don\'t be fooled by their simplicity. Their simplicity gives them elegance. You\'ll enjoy learning labels.\n\nThe steps to labeling. The first step is you simply being aware of the emotion or the dynamic from the other side. Now, this is a lot easier than it sounds because you\'ve got a great gut instinct. Becoming aware of what your gut instinct is picking up is the first step. Then the second step after that is to simply label it. That starts out with it seems like, it sounds like, it looks like, it feels like. Those are the first few words of a label, and then just fill in the blank. If your gut instinct is to say, look, I don\'t want you to be upset about this, your gut instinct is picking up that they are upset or they will be upset. So take it and make it a label. It seems like you\'re upset about this. What happens in your brain is you say to yourself, am I upset? It triggers that contemplation. And the mere act of triggering that contemplation deactivates the negative. So my labels are going to do several things simultaneously. They\'re going to build the relationship, and they\'re going to help me gather information. And since both of those things are happening, then my influence with you is going to increase. And the great thing about this type of influence, this approach to influence-- this is what I call trust-based influence. It\'s the lowest-maintenance, most durable type of influence there is.\n\nA wrong way to label something involves the phrase ""what I\'m hearing."" Now, a lot of people have been taught to say, ""well, what I\'m hearing is."" By starting out with ""what I\'m hearing is,"" I\'ve dropped the word ""I"" in inappropriately, and the message that I\'m conveying is that I\'m more interested in my perspective than yours. It\'s also important that you resist the urge to explain a label or to add some follow-up or to talk in any way, actually, after a good label. A good label, you\'ve got to let it sink in. You\'ve got to let it have its effect. You\'ve got to let it trigger the type of contemplation, the type of thinking that you want to have triggered in the other side. You got to let it fully deactivate the negatives. So after you\'ve made a great label, you\'ve got to shut up. You gotta shut the front door. You got to stop talking. Even if you get another good label, let the first one hit hard and sink in before you follow up with the second label or before you ask a great question. Let your label sink in. Don\'t explain them. Don\'t step on them.\n\nIn a lot of circumstances, it\'s probably going to take more than one label of a negative to completely diffuse or deactivate the negative. Labels are cumulative. I will coach you that labeling negatives diffuses, diminishes them every time. The important part of that is to remember although I said it what kind of effect it would have, I didn\'t tell you the degree of impact. I didn\'t tell you how much it would deactivate or diffuse the negative. Sometimes it\'s a little. Sometimes it\'s a lot. So you may label a negative emotion,'
 "" it a bunch of other things, and the simplest name was the most descriptive. Now, why is it helpful? Well, again, this negativity thing that we're talking about, and this brain science experiment, this neuroscience experiment has been duplicated a number of times, and it's always come out the same. First time I read about it was in a book called The Upward Spiral. They put people in fMRIs where they could watch the electrical activity move through their brain, functional magnetic resonance imaging device. Watch the electricity move in your brain. They show people a photograph that induces a negative emotion. I don't know what the photographs were. It could have been a puppy in the rain. It could have been a little old lady on the street homeless. Who knows? But they knew that the photograph would induce a negative emotion. Show them the picture and watch that part of the amygdala that I talked about earlier light up. The three quarters that's been identified is where negative emotions are generated. And then they say, what are you feeling? Simply label the feeling in the moment. Every single time the person labeled the negative, not some of the time, not half the time, every time, the electrical activity in the amygdala diminished. Every time, 1,000% of the time. Now, the caveat is the degree of diminishment varies. Sometimes you might label a negative emotion and it only goes down by 1%. Sometimes you label it and it goes all the way down. Occasionally, a label of a negative can have an imperceivable impact. It still had the impact. You just need more. The principal issue was this thing that you asked me about a moment ago, these labels, especially the labels of negatives, not the denials, but the labels work every time. How does this impact us in interactions? What you might want to say, what you might want to deny, what's your gut instinct saying like, look, I don't want to seem greedy here. I don't want it to seem like I'm pushing you. I don't want to seem disrespectful. The two millimeter shift is to go from the denial to the label. Like I'm probably going to seem disrespectful. I'm sure this is going to seem like I'm pushing you. I'm sure it's going to seem like I'm sure this is going to seem like I'm pushing. I'm sure it's going to seem like I'm greedy. We've never had that backfire on us ever, ever, ever. People are horrified that they say that your reaction is going to be, well, I didn't think you were going to be greedy. But now that you mentioned it, I do. You are probably greedy. We ain't having that happen. Not only that, we know that it inoculates people from negatives. Like if I get something that I know you're going to react negatively to, again, which means if I know you're going to react negatively, it means that negative is not there. If I'm getting ready to say something that it's going to make me seem greedy, I'm going to say, this is going to make me seem greedy. And I'm going to let that sink in for about the count of three, no more. And then I'm going to say it. What's your reaction consistently on the other side? It wasn't. I thought it was going to be worse. Yeah, I thought it was going to be worse. I appreciate that you're being honest. I mean, that's a superpower. You know, that's the original Star Wars. These are not the droids you were looking for. And I think what's cool is sometimes, even if you're not exactly right on the label by at least putting some kind of label on it, they may, they may correct you on that. Talk a little bit about that. Yeah. You know, and I'm glad you brought that up because this whole correction thing, You know, and I'm glad you brought that up because this whole correction thing, that's a superpower to the willingness to be corrected. A lot of people are horrified of being corrected because it makes them feel bad. It makes them embarrassed. You know, I don't want to be corrected. I don't want to look like I'm wrong. Why? Because it bothers you. But empathy is not about you. What happens when somebody corrects you? They're stepping to your side. It's a dynamic that you were talking about earlier. Like, how do you get people on your side of the table? Well, to correct someone is to help them. That means that they're no longer an adversary. Now, they may feel superior to you, and that's a secondary issue, depending upon whether or not you want to exploit it or smooth it out. It's actually usually better to exploit it, but they're on your side of the table the minute they correct you to start with. That's the first advantage. The second advantage""]",Labeling emotions in negative states decreases the electrical activity in the negative part of the amygdala.
